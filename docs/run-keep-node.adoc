= Run Keep Node

[#system-considerations]
== System Considerations

The Keep Network expects certain capabilities for each node running on the network.
To help attain these capabilities consider the following criteria:

- It is paramount that Keep nodes remain available to the Keep Network. 
We strongly encourage a stable and redundant internet connection.
See <<config-network>> section.

- A connection to a production grade self-hosted or third party Ethereum node deployment.
See <<config-ethereum-api>> section.

- Persistent and redundant storage that will survive a VM or container rotation, and a disk failure.
See <<config-persistance>> section.

- Each node running on the network requires a unique Ethereum Operator Account.
The account has to maintain a positive Ether balance at all times.
See <<config-operator-account>> section.

- Each node running on the network requires a unique IP address or a unique
application port running under the same IP.
See <<config-network>> section.

=== Recommended Machine Types

Your operating environment will ultimately dictate what machine type to go with.  This is
particularly relevant if you're running a containerized solution where multiple applications
are sharing VM resources.  The below types are sufficient for running at least one instance of the
Keep Node.

== Starting a Client

[#configuration]
=== Configuration

The client expects configuration options to be specified in a <<config-file,config file>> 
or passed as <<cli,CLI flags>>. If you specify an option by using a parameter on 
the command line, it will override the value read from the configuration file.

[#config-operator-account]
==== Operator Account

The client requires an Ethereum Key File of an Operator Account to connect to the
Ethereum chain. 

The Ethereum Key File is expected to be encrypted with a password. The password has
to be provided in a prompt after the client starts or configured as a `KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD`
environment variable.

The Operator Account has to maintain a positive Ether balance at all times.
We strongly advice you monitor the account and top-up when its balance gets below
0,5 Ether. 

// TODO: Link to a reimbursements documentation.

[#config-ethereum-api]
==== Ethereum API

A Keep Node requires a connection to a WebSocket Ethereum API. You should obtain
a WS API URL from a service provider 
(e.g. link:https://www.alchemy.com/[Alchemy], link:https://www.infura.io/[Infura]) 
or run your own Ethereum node
(e.g. link:https://geth.ethereum.org/[Geth]).

[#cli]
==== CLI Options

[source,bash,role=small]
----
include::./resources/client-start-help[]
----

[#config-file]
==== Config File

Application configuration can be stored in a file and passed to the application
with the `--config` flag. 

Example:
[source,bash]
----
./keep-client --config /path/to/your/config.toml start
----

Configuration files in formats TOML, YAML and JSON are supported.

Sample configuration file:

[source,toml,role=small]
----
include::../configs/config.toml.SAMPLE[]
----

[#config-persistance]
==== Persistance

A client will produce and store data on disk. The directory should be provided to
the client under `storage.Dir` (flag: `--storage.dir`) configuration property.

WARNING: It is crucial to ensure the data directory is persisted and backed up on
a regular basis.

There will be two subdirectories created in the storage directory:
- `keystore`,
- `work`.

===== `keystore`

The `keystore` subdirectory contains sensitive key material data generated by the
client.
Loosing the `keystore` data is a serious protocol offense and leads
to slashing and potentially losing funds.

IMPORTANT:  It is the operator's responsibility to ensure the keystore data are not
lost under any circumstances.

===== `work`

The `work` directory contains data generated by the client that should persist
the client restarts or relocations.
If the `work` data are lost the client will be able to recreate them, but it
is inconvenient due to the time needed for the operation to complete and may lead to losing rewards.

[#config-network]
==== Network

The node has to be accessible publicly to establish and maintain connections with
bootstrap nodes and discovered peers.

The node exposes <<metrics,metrics>> and <<diagnostics,diagnostics>> services for
monitoring.

===== Ports

A *Network* Port has to be exposed publicly, so the peers can connect to your node.
// TODO: Add link to the Rewards Allocation documentation.
A *Diagnostics* Port has to be exposed publicly, for the Rewards Allocation. 

IMPORTANT: Please update your firewall rules if necessary.

|===

===== Announced Addresses

An Announced Address is a layered addressing information (`multiaddress`/`multiaddr`)
announced to the Keep Network that is used by peers to connect with your node, e.g.:
`/dns4/bootstrap-0.test.keep.network/tcp/3919` or `/ip4/104.154.61.116/tcp/3919`.

If the machine you're running your node is not exposing a public IP (e.g. it is
behind NAT) you should set the `network.AnnouncedAddresses` 
(flag: `--network.announcedAddresses`) configuration property to an addresses 
(`ip4` or `dns4`) under which your node is reachable for the public.

To read more about `multiaddress` see the
link:https://docs.libp2p.io/reference/glossary/#multiaddr[libp2p docummentation].

==== Minimum Required Configuration

The minimum required configuration for the client to start covers setting:

- `KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD` environment variable (see: <<config-operator-account>> section),
- `ethereum.url` config property (see: <<config-ethereum-api>> section),
- `ethereum.keyFile` config property (see: <<config-operator-account>> section),
- `storage.dir` config property (see: <<config-persistance>> section).

TIP: If you want to share your LibP2P address with others you can get it from the
startup log.  When sharing remember to substitute the `/ipv4/` address with the public facing IP of your client if you're running on a private machine, or replace the entire
`/ipv4/` segment with a DNS entry if you're using a hostname.

[#clientInfo]
== Client Info

The client exposes metrics and diagnostics on a configurable port (default: `9601`)
under `/metrics` and `/diagnostics` resources.

The data can be consumed by Prometheus to monitor the state of a node.

[#metrics]
=== Metrics

The client exposes the following metrics:

- connected peers count,
- connected bootstraps count,
- Ethereum client connectivity status (if a simple read-only CALL can be executed).

Metrics are enabled once the client starts. It is possible to customize the port 
at which metrics endpoint is exposed as well as the frequency with which 
the metrics are collected.

Exposed metrics contain the value and timestamp at which they were collected.

Example metrics endpoint call result:
```
$ curl localhost:9601/metrics
# TYPE connected_peers_count gauge
connected_peers_count 108 1623235129569

# TYPE connected_bootstrap_count gauge
connected_bootstrap_count 10 1623235129569

# TYPE eth_connectivity gauge
eth_connectivity 1 1623235129789
```

[#diagnostics]
=== Diagnostics

The client exposes the following diagnostics:

- list of connected peers along with their network id and Ethereum operator address,
- information about the client's network id and Ethereum operator address.

Diagnostics are enabled once the client starts. It is possible to customize
the port at which diagnostics endpoint is exposed.

Example diagnostics endpoint call result:
```
$ curl localhost:9601/diagnostics
{
  "client_info" { 
   "ethereum_address":"0xDcd4199e22d09248cA2583cBDD2759b2acD22381",
   "network_id":"16Uiu2HAkzYFHsqbwt64ZztWWK1hyeLntRNqWMYFiZjaKu1PZgikN"
  },
  "connected_peers": [
    {"ethereum_address":"0x3712C6fED51CECA83cA953f6FF3458f2339436b4","network_id":"16Uiu2HAkyYtzNoWuF3ULaA7RMfVAxvfQQ9YRvRT3TK4tXmuZtaWi"},
    {"ethereum_address":"0x4bFa10B1538E8E765E995688D8EEc39C717B6797","network_id":"16Uiu2HAm9d4MG4LNrwkFmugD2pX7frm6ZmA4vE3EFAEjk7yaoeLd"},
