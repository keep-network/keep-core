.Global constants
|===
|Variable |Formula |Meaning

|**N**
|H + M~max~ = 2M~max~ + 1 = 4M~fail~ + 1
|Number of participants in a group

|**H**
|M~max~ + 1
|Minimum number of honest participants in a group

|**M~max~**
|H - 1 = (N - 1)/2
|Maximum number of malicious participants in a group
beyond which security guarantees don't hold

|**M~fail~**
|M~max~/2 = (N - 1)/4
|Threshold of inactive or misbehaving nodes
beyond which the DKG does not finish
|===

.Time limits
|===
|Variable |Meaning
|**T~p~**
|Time limit for phase _p_ of the key generation;
after _T~p~_ has elapsed every non-inactive participant is assumed
to have broadcast its own message for phase _p_ and received others' messages

|**T~dkg~**
|Time limit for the distributed key generation to finish
and _P~1~_ to submit the result

|**T~step~**
|Time limit after which
the next participant in line
becomes eligible to submit the result

|**T~conflict~**
|Time limit after which
any disputes over the correct result are assumed to be resolved,
with the plurality being honest
|===

.Rewards and punishmens
|===
|Variable |Meaning
|===

.Values at the time of group creation
|===
|Variable |Meaning
|**V~i~**
|**_i_**th output of the random beacon

|**S**
|The set of all stakers at the time of _V~i~_

|**P**
|The candidate group of players selected from _S_ with _V~i~_,
who will try to perform the key generation to create signing group _G_

|**P~j~**
|__j__-th node in _P_ based on the group candidate selection algorithm
|===

.Values in the DKG protocol
|===
|Variable |Formula |Meaning
|**IA~p~**
|
|The set of nodes in _P_ that first failed to broadcast a required message within
a specified time limit in phase _p_ and were thus added to the set of inactive
nodes after that phase

|**IA**
|IA~1~ + IA~2~ + ...
|The set of inactive nodes in _P_ (nodes that failed to broadcast a required
message within a specified time limit during the DKG)

|**DQ~p~**
|
|The set of nodes in _P_ that were disqualified in phase _p_ for provably and
attributably violating the protocol

|**DQ**
|DQ~1~ + DQ~2~ + ...
|The set of all disqualified nodes in _P_

|**G~p~**
|G~p-1~ - IA~p-1~ - DQ~p-1~
|The set of nodes in _P_ that were active and well-behaved at the
beginning of phase _p_ (_G~1~= P_)

|**G**
|P - IA - DQ
|The successfully created group after removal of inactive
and misbehaving nodes
|===

.Keys
|===
|Variable |Meaning
|**X~i~**
|Long-term ECDSA private key of _P~i~_

|**Y~i~**
|Long-term ECDSA public key of _P~i~_

|**x~ij~**
|Ephemeral ECDH private key of _P~i~_ for the purpose of encrypted communication
with _P~j~_

|**y~ij~**
|Ephemeral ECDH public key of _P~i~_ for the purpose of encrypted communication
with _P~j~_

|**k~ij~ = k~ji~**
|Symmetric key generated by _P~i~_ for encrypting and decrypting communications
with _P~j~_ using _k~ij~ = ECDH(x~ij~, y~ji~)_

|**X**
|The (virtual) private key corresponding to the group _G'_

|**Y**
|The public key corresponding to the group _G'_
