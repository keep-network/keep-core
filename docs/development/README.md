### [Getting started with `geth` on the test network](getting-started-ethereum.adoc)

A note-taken walkthrough of how to start from not having anything connected to
Ethereum to developing the basics of a smart contract that can emit events and
deploying it on the Rinkeby test network. Covers running `geth`, getting it
hooked into the Rinkeby testnet, getting some eth from the faucet, and
interacting with the JSON-RPC API. Also covers some basic solidity, compiling
it, and using JSON-RPC to install a contract and call it. Relatively low-level,
to provide some familiarity with how Ethereum works under the covers.
