== Getting Set Up

If you're on macOS, install Homebrew and run `scripts/macos-setup.sh`. Note
that if you don't have Homebrew or you're not on macOS, the below information
details what you'll need. The script additionally sets up pre-commit hooks.

== Building

Currently the easiest way to build is using the `Dockerfile` at the root of the
repository. A simple `docker build` should get you a functioning container.

If you want to build natively, there are a few prereqs you'll need to go through.
First, you'll need to clone `keep-network/bn` from GitHub and run `make
install`. To successfully build `bn`, you'll need to have `libgmp` (with
headers) and `openssl` (also with headers) installed, as well as the LLVM
developer tools. On macOS, you can `brew install gmp openssl llvm` to install
all of these. Note that `llvm` requires some additional env variable work that
the formula will explain when you install it.

You'll also need https://github.com/golang/dep=installation[`dep`], the Go
dependency manager we use.

Lastly, you'll need the https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads[protobuf compiler].
You'll also need to install the `protoc-gen-gogoslick` toolchain, which you can
install using `go get`:

```
go get -u github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gogoslick
```

Finally, you can run `dep ensure` in the root directory of this repository and
you'll be ready to build!

Run `+go generate ./.../+` from `keep-core` and if everything is fine, start the
Keep client with `go run main.go`.

== Development Guidelines

There are two primary languages in the Keep code right now:

Go::
  Go code largely adheres to community practices where they have been decided.
  Divergences and additional tidbits are listed in the link:go-guidelines.adoc[Go
  Guidelines] document.

Solidity::
  Solidity code generally adheres to the
  https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html[Solidity style guide].
  Contracts and their functions are documented using
  https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format[the
  Ethereum Natural Specification Format] (NatSpec).

== Relay States

There is a set of threshold relay state diagrams auto-generated from this
repo's `docs` available at https://docs.keep.network/relay-states.pdf. The
images in the diagram, whose sources are at `img-src/*.tikz`, are also
available at `+https://docs.keep.network/img/generated/*.png+` (the filenames
are identical to their TikZ sources, with a `.png` suffix instead of
`.tikz`). These URLs are for the `master` version of the repo; non-`master`
branches are instead published to `+https://docs.keep.network/<branch name>/+`.

== link:getting-started-ethereum.adoc[Getting started with `geth` on the test network]

A note-taken walkthrough of how to start from not having anything connected to
Ethereum to developing the basics of a smart contract that can emit events and
deploying it on the Rinkeby test network. Covers running `geth`, getting it
hooked into the Rinkeby testnet, getting some eth from the faucet, and
interacting with the JSON-RPC API. Also covers some basic solidity, compiling
it, and using JSON-RPC to install a contract and call it. Relatively low-level,
to provide some familiarity with how Ethereum works under the covers.

== Common problems

Please avoid using `~` when defining `$GOBIN` location and use `$HOME` instead.
We've been observing https://github.com/google/protobuf/issues/3355[some issues] 
with locating `protoc-gen-gogoslick` when running `go generate` and `$GOBIN` 
contained `~`.

== Working with Solidity contracts

The fastest and easiest way to have local Ethereum testent is to use Ganache app.
https://truffleframework.com/ganache/

You can also use a demo script to help you deploy contracts to your local testnet
and to have demo balances (token, staking and token grants) allocated between first
two accounts.

Go to `contracts/solidity` directory and run:

```
npm install
npm run demo
```
