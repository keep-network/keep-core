= T developer documentation

== Quick installation

=== Pre-requirements

For development purposes, it is convenient to set up a local Ethereum client with
a group of connected peers. A note-taken walkthrough 
xref:local-t-network.adoc[set up local T network] covers the entire process
including setting up a local Ethereum client, deploying T contracts and
configuring T peers.

Additionally, to start a client we need to provide configuration options. It is
required to create a config file under `/configs` for each client. You can also
overwrite the existing config file by passing supported parameters. For simple 
installation using a config file please refer to the 
xref:../run-keep-node.adoc#config-file[configuration] section.

=== Starting a client

To quickly setup and start a client use the following scripts from the project root:

* `./scripts/install.sh`
* `./scripts/initialize.sh`
* `./scrtips/start.sh`

== Installation scripts explained

=== install.sh

The `./scripts/install.sh` needs to be run only once and it will:

* install yarn dependencies across the projects
* unlock ethereum accounts 
* build `threshold-network/solidity-contracts`, `random-beacon`, `ecdsa` and 
`tbtc-v2` contracts
* deploy `threshold-network/solidity-contracts`, `random-beacon`, `ecdsa` and 
`tbtc-v2` contracts 
* build a client

For more info please refer to `./scripts/install.sh --help`

```
Usage: 
  ENV_VAR(S) ./scripts/install.sh \
  --network <network> \
  --tbtc-path <tbtc-path> \
  --threshold-network-path <threshold-network-path> \
  --skip-deployment \
  --skip-client-build

Environment variables:

        KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD: The password to unlock local Ethereum accounts to set up delegations. Required only for 'local' network. Default value is 'password'

Optional line arguments:

        --network: Ethereum network for keep-core client(s). Available networks and settings are specified in the 'hardhat.config.ts'
        --tbtc-path: 'Local' tbtc project's path. 'tbtc' is cloned to a temporary directory upon installation if the path is not provided
        --threshold-network-path: 'Local' threshold network project's path. 'threshold-network/solidity-contracts' is cloned to a temporary directory upon installation if the path is not provided
        --skip-deployment: This option skips all the contracts deployment. Default is false
        --skip-client-build: Should execute contracts part only. Client installation will not be executed
```

=== initialize.sh

The `./scripts/initialize.sh` has to be run for each client instance you wish to
start. 

If the `--stake-owner <address>` is not set, then it will prompt you to select a
configuration file that will be used to fetch the stake owner's address from. 
Default setup assumes that the staking provider, operator, beneficiary, and the 
authorizer all have the same addresses as the stake owner. Only the `stake-owner` 
has to be unique for the default setup. The default stake amount is `1,000,000 T` 
tokens. The default authorization amount is the minimum authorization amount.

Ex. if you need to initialize a network with 3 clients using the default setup, 
then this script needs to be run 3 times with a different selected config file 
like so:

```
./scripts/initialize.sh

Select client config file:
1) config.toml <--
2) config1.toml
3) config2.toml
```
```
./scripts/initialize.sh

Select client config file:
1) config.toml
2) config1.toml <--
3) config2.toml
``` 
```
./scripts/initialize.sh

Select client config file:
1) config.toml
2) config1.toml
3) config2.toml <--
``` 

The `+./scripts/initialize.sh+` script will:

* mint & approve `T` tokens
* stake `T` tokens
* increase authorization for `RandomBeacon` and `WalletRegistry` applications
* register operator for `RandomBeacon` and `WalletRegistry` applications

For more info please refer to `./scripts/initialize.sh --help`

```
Usage: 
./scripts/initialize.sh \
  --network <network> \
  --stake-owner <stake owner address> \
  --staking-provider <staking provider address> \
  --operator <operator address> \
  --beneficiary <beneficiary address> \
  --authorizer <authorizer address> \
  --stake-amount <stake amount> \
  --authorization-amount <authorization amount>

Optional line arguments:

        --network: Ethereum network for keep-core client. Available networks and settings are specified in the 'hardhat.config.ts'
        --stake-owner: Stake owner address
        --staking-provider: Staking provider address
        --operator: Operator address
        --beneficiary: Staking beneficiary address
        --authorizer: Staking authorizer address
        --stake-amount: Stake amount
        --authorization-amount: Authorization amount
```

=== start.sh

Afer executing `./scripts/install.sh` and `./scripts/initialize.sh` now you can
run `./scripts/start.sh` to start a client. It will prompt you to chose from the
available config files (that should match the one chosen for 
`./scripts/initialize.sh`) and the log level.

```
./scripts/start.sh

Select client config file:
1) config.toml <--
2) config1.toml
3) config2.toml
1

Select log level [info]:
1) info
2) debug
3) custom...
```
```
./scripts/start.sh

Select client config file:
1) config.toml
2) config1.toml <--
3) config2.toml
2

Select log level [info]:
1) info
2) debug
3) custom...
``` 
```
./scripts/start.sh

Select client config file:
1) config.toml
2) config1.toml
3) config2.toml <--
3

Select log level [info]:
1) info
2) debug
3) custom...
```

Please refer to
`./scripts/start.sh --help` for more info

```
./scripts/start.sh --help

Usage: ENV_VAR(S) ./scripts/start.sh --config-dir <path-to-configuration-files>

Environment variables:

        KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD: Ethereum account password. Required only for 'local' network. Default value is 'password'

Command line arguments:

        --config-dir: Path to a client configuration files
```

== Development Guidelines

There are two primary languages in the T code right now:

Go::
  Go code largely adheres to community practices where they have been decided.
  Divergences and additional tidbits are listed in the link:go-guidelines.adoc[Go
  Guidelines] document.

Solidity::
  Solidity code generally adheres to the
  https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html[Solidity style guide].
  Contracts and their functions are documented using
  https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/natspec-format.html[the
  Ethereum Natural Specification Format] (NatSpec).

== Working with Solidity contracts

The fastest and easiest way to have a local Ethereum testent is to use
https://hardhat.org/[Hardhat].


Navigate to one of the projects `solidity/ecdsa` or `solidity/random-beacon`.
You can deploy contracts executing `yarn deploy` or run tests against the local
Hardhat's network `yarn test`.
