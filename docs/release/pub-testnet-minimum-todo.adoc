= Keep Public Testnet - Minimum Todo

A stab at minimum effort to get the Keep public testnet off the ground.

== Pre-launch

- Private testnet *[Owner: Sloan]*
  ** Running two weeks without a reset

- Audit *[Owner: Antonio]*
  ** pre-audit
    **** Auditor selection
    **** Decide how we cut to-be audit code
  ** post-audit
    **** Decision to incorporate feedback before pub testnet launch

- Internal Infrastructure *[Owner: Sloan]*
  ** GH project / Regional GKE cluster / Tooling deployment
  ** Launch N keep seed bootstrap peers (regular peers?)
  ** Metrics dashboard
  ** Business hours on-call rotation
  ** Deploy on merge to master

- Documentation *[Owner: ""]*
  ** Where
  ** Compile run client from source
  ** Run Docker container
  ** Sample config
  ** Relevant contract addresses (KeepRandomBeacon / KeepGroup / Staking)
  ** List of Bootstrap peers
  ** How to get tokens
  ** Links to comms channels
  ** API docs

- OSS *[Owner: Antonio]*
  ** Licensing
  ** How to contribute README
  ** Comms around decision making process here (cultural impact)

- Contract deployment *[Owner: ""]*
  ** Decide on timing
  ** Who

- Comms *[Owner: Sam]*
  ** Leaning on Sam here
  ** https://www.flowdock.com/app/cardforcoin/keep/threads/gHSQuztGWzJV1BqFFbRDH1l50Pu
  ** Dev access - How we handle community feedback into the dev team

- Token distribution *[Owner: ""]*
  ** How
  ** If faucet, need an interface

- Bug Bounty *[Owner: ""]*
  ** Maybe we can move this into post-launch
  ** How much
  ** Submission template
  ** Public praise, maybe a special slack badge (rando thought while typing this stuff out)


== At-launch

- OSS the beacon *[Owner: ""]*
  ** Sort of coordinated marketing effort/announcement (Note from Antonio: May be mainnet not sure)

- Coordinated Comms announcement *[Owner: Laura]*

- ~~party? *[Owner: "ALL"]*~~ Antonio is a party pooper


== Post-launch (Current and future testnet releases)

- Multi-regional peer deployment *[Owner: Sloan]*

- Mining *[Owner: Matt]*

- Slashing *[Owner: ""]*

- Testing *[Owner: Sloan]*
  ** Destructive
  ** Sizing
  ** Network fuzzing
  ** Performance metrics
  ** Log tuning
