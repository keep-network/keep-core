== Pre-launch

- Private testnet *[Owner: Sloan]*
  ** Running two weeks without a reset

- Audit *[Owner: ""]*
  ** pre-audit
    **** Auditor selection
    **** Decide how we cut to-be audit code
  ** post-audit
    **** Decision to incorporate feedback before pub testnet launch

- Internal Infrastructure *[Owner: Sloan]*
  ** GH project / Regional GKE cluster / Tooling deployment
  ** Launch N keep seed bootstrap peers (regular peers?)
  ** Metrics dashboard
  ** Business hours on-call rotation

- Documentation *[Owner: ""]*
  ** Where
  ** Compile run client from source
  ** Run Docker container
  ** Sample config

  ** Dev access - How we handle community feedback into the dev team

- Token distribution *[Owner: ""]*
  ** How
  ** If faucet, need an interface

- Bug Bounty *[Owner: ""]*
  ** Maybe we can move this into post-launch
  ** How much
