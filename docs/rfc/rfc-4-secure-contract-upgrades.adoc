== Background

Following best practices for ERC-20 Tokens, we have non-upgradable and
non-ownable Token and Token staking contracts, which means there is no
backdoor to modify the contract storage or change the implementation.
Amongst other things, these contracts only allow token transfers to be
executed by the token holders. Since token staking functionality might
need upgrading, it was decided to simply issue and deploy a new contract
and advise stakers to migrate their balances to it.

A different upgrade approach taken from Open Zeppelin was implemented for
the rest of the contracts; this RFC states the pitfalls of the approach and
proposes alternative way similar to what we already have for Token staking
contracts.


=== Current Functionality

Current upgrading functionality influenced by Open Zeppelin libraries makes
upgradable contract address and storage persistent and the logic can be
upgraded by the contract owner. They do so by updating the implementation
address in the persistent proxy contract. The method is also known as
"Eternal Storage". This was considered a good approach for all the
forthcoming Keep contracts including Group selection and Random beacon.
A concern has been raised during implementation of stake slashing
functionality where an upgradable contract such as Group Contract has to
be authorized to modify stake balances. Since the address and storage are
persistent in case of a compromised implementation all staked balances are
at risk. Imagine a deploy key that is used to update the implementation is
stolen, the hacker has full access to the contract storage immediately by
updating contract with his implementation. Besides if the contract address
was authorized to move stakers balances those will be lost as well.


=== Goal

Minimize the risk of lost/stolen staked tokens in the case of a hacked or
bad implementation upgrade of the contracts that require full access to
modify balance of a staker.

=== Implementation

Each new contract that does "slashing/reward" changes on staked token
balances must be a non-upgradable and non-ownable one to minimize attack
surface. Functionality upgrades are only possible by deploying a new
implementation as a new contract. The address of this contract must be
re-authorized by a staker. Stakers do so by calling the `authorize(address)`
method on a staking contract. A client should only authorize official
contract addresses from the metacontract list maintained by Keep
organization along with the confirmation by two or more Keybase-proven
channels.

The contracts with `authorize()` method should also include a "panic button"
- a method that cancels all authorizations in case of emergency. This
should be restricted to be called by a Keep organization account used to
deploy this contract.


=== Limitations

Not particularly a limitation but a move from being able to do a seamless
and instant upgrade to a drawn-out one where stakers have to reauthorize
a newly deployed version.

=== Proof of Concept

The basis for the concept can be seen in the current Staking contracts
and StakingProxy.sol
