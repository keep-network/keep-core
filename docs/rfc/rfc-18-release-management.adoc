== Background

Releasing Keep and tBTC involves executing a mix of automated and manual
tasks in a specific order. Release tasks span multiple Github repositories
and software tools. A full release requires approximately 8 hours of work for
an individual already familiar with the tasks, task ordering, and nuance of
executing a full release.

The number of moving pieces and state at any given part of the release
process is non-trivial, susceptible to human error, with a high probability
of having to "re-run" certain parts of the release before you can move onto
the next step.

While this RFC will aim to outline potential steps for minimizing the above
(less than ideal) conditions, it's important to note that they will still
exist to some degree regardless of what we do. This is a big complicated
ship, moving it requires coordination across teams, repos, modules, and the
process itself. Releasing is beholden to external systems we do not control.

How we got to this point is likely a point of debate, however the defining
factor is that we did not account for the complexity being inherited into the
release process as we began integrating various parts of the Keep and tBTC
systems. As these systems came together we forged ahead bolting more
complicated scripts and process onto existing build pipelines to handle the
orchestration between now interdependent modules. To complicate this further
we scripted some parts of orchestration related to module interdependence and
not others, resulting in the need for manual intervention at various steps of
release.

It's arguable that our situation was a double-edged sword. At the outset
systems were rapidly evolving independently of each other, the build and
release process was structured in a way to accommodate this environment. As
integrations started playing out it would have been challenging to
re-engineer the release process at the same time. Now that the system is
largely complete with better understanding of module interdependence, it's a
good time to have a look at the release process to see what we can improve
upon.

==== Versioning

We use https://semver.org[semantic versioning] with the additional
distinction of, **Development (x.x.x-pre) → Testnet (x.x.x-rc) → Mainnet
(x.x.x)**.

Not all modules that should be explicitly versioned are. See below table for
modules involved with a full release and their versioning status:

.Versions
|=====
| Repository      | Module                      | Versioned | Location

| keep-common     | go library                  |    yes    | repository tag
| keep-core       | contracts                   |    yes    | package.json
| keep-core       | go client                   |    yes    | repository tag
| keep-core       | token-dashboard (js client) |    yes    | package.json
| keep-ecdsa      | contracts                   |    yes    | package.json
| keep-ecdsa      | go client                   |    yes    | repository tag
| sortition-pools | contracts                   |    yes    | package.json
| tbtc            | contracts                   |    yes    | package.json
| tbtc.js         | library                     |    yes    | package.json
| tbtc-dapp       | js client                   |    yes    | package.json
|=====

==== General Release Flow

Here we'll step through a sample flow for a release. Please note the top path
of the flowchart is exercised for each repo being released, e.g. keep-core
and keep-ecdsa would go through this top portion of the flowchart,
independently.

Another non-obvious factor to note here is that when a repo houses both
contract and go client code (e.g. keep-core), the current release process
does not allow you to release just the client, should no contract changes be
made. This results in a release flow that requires both contract and client
build/deploys regardless of what changed.

image::rfc-18-files/release-flow-chart.png[Flow chart of the current release process]

==== Interdependencies

One complicating factor for releasing is that certain modules are dependent
on each other, and dependent modules span code repositories. Upstream context
for module changes aren't sent downstream during release, these changes are
accounted for manually by a person making sure `package.json` files are
versioned properly, or by scripts that assume changes were made and fetch the
latest contract artifacts from a Google storage bucket. This is a
particularly hairy failure point as mistakes can go unaccounted for until
deploy time, resulting in potentially having to redo large parts of the
release. Handling these interdependencies programmatically, and with specific
context of the upstream state as to minimize downstream work is critical to
having a more robust, less error prone, and shorter release process.

To illustrate: tbtc contract initialization depends on having the keep-ecdsa
`BondedECDSAKeepFactory` contract address for the environment being released.
The `BondedECDSAKeepFactory` address is produced outside of the release context
that tbtc has and therefore must be passed explicitly to the tbtc release
context before tbtc contract initialization can happen. The
`BondedECDSAKeepFactory` address fetch currently happens via a script executed
during the tbtc CircleCI migration job. The script fetches relevant
keep-ecdsa contract artifacts from a Google storage bucket that is assumed to
be up to date by an earlier process run during the keep-ecdsa release, that
publishes contract artifacts to this storage bucket. The fetch script has no
way of knowing if the contract artifact is the correct one for the release
being run.

== Proposal

The next iteration of our release process should incorporate learnings from
our current process and stay flexible for the future. To achieve this we’re
going to have to touch all aspects of the current process, including:
versioning, tooling, and the release flow itself.

Any part of the system should be releasable at any time, with modules that
have upstream dependencies being aware of upstream module release and having
their own release initiated in response, at the appropriate time.

=== Goal

For a properly modular release process, **each module in the system should be
able to build and publish its own artifacts where relevant**, and **each module
should be able to trigger any downstream builds** as necessary, irrespective of
whether they share the same repository or not. To do this, contract releases,
client releases, and dApp releases must be decoupled. Each one should be
runnable independently of the others against any environment configured for
deployment. Additionally, **modules themselves must be independently
versionable**. dApps must not be versioned in lockstep with clients, contracts
must not be versioned in lockstep with dApps, etc. Each of these should be
able to live as independently evolving modules, from a version perspective.

To properly manage contract deployment across various Ethereum testnets and
mainnet, and to reflect the fact that deploying contracts to mainnet is not
necessarily a declaration of a final version, **artifact versions must be able
to differentiate between pre-releases (whether RC or otherwise) on mainnet vs
testnets**. Versions that are declared final may be deployed to a testnet, and
versions that are declared pre-release may be deployed to mainnet.

=== Implementation

The implementation presented here has two primary parts:

* Build tagging/publishing.
* Inter-module dependency management.

==== Build tagging/publishing

===== Builds

The proposal is to move to GitHub Actions for all builds, and set up one
build per module. All GitHub Actions builds would be set up to trigger on
three events:

* `push` to `master`, to run merge builds
* `pull_request`, to run PR builds
* `workflow_dispatch` with some additional parameters to publish artifacts,
  described more <<workflow-dispatch-event,below>>

Each GitHub Actions module build should have `migrate`/`publish` steps (in
Actions parlance, ``job``s) that run conditionally; these jobs should run only
as a result of the `workflow_dispatch` event, not for pushes or pull requests.

===== Versioning

All module builds with versions that are not derived from the tag (e.g. npm,
but not necessarily Go) will receive a new version for each build, even if
the build goes unpublished. Versions will follow a consistent (and
semver-compatible) format across all artifact types that support it:

```
    <base-version>-<environment>.<build-number>+<branch>.<commit>
```

The components are defined as follows:

`base-version`::
    A manually-incremented `major.minor.patch` semver version that is committed
    to the repository. Bumping this version requires a human committing an
    incremented version.
`environment`::
    The environment we are building for; for builds that will not publish,
    the environment should match the development environment used for builds
    that publish to the development testnet.
`build-number`::
    Auto-incremented for each published build. This means that builds that
    don’t publish can produce several builds under a single build number
    until a build is published.
`branch`::
    Unless a build is unattached to a branch, this should be the branch for
    the build. For example, for pushes to `master`, this will be `master`.
    For PR builds, this will be the PR branch.
`commit`::
    The commit hash for the current build.

Versions that are deployed to mainnet are special; these carry only the
`<base-version>` with an optional `-rc.<build-number>` for a mainnet
deployment considered a release candidate. Mainnet versions are also
currently deployed manually, so publishing is not expected to occur in the
automated pipeline for these versions.

===== Tagging

Tagging for modules is based on their path in the repository and the version
of the module. These versions do not need to be correlated between modules.
As an example, consider the repository at `github.com/keep-network/keep-core`.
It has three modules: the Go client, the Solidity contracts, and the Keep
token dashboard. A 1.0.0 version for each of these modules would be tagged as
`v1.0.0` (Go client), `solidity/v1.0.0` (Solidity contracts), and
`token-dashboard/v1.0.0` (token dashboard).

In addition to being clear on which module is being tagged, this also happens
to follow with go mod‘s module versioning strategy, so it will be
forward-compatible to managing multiple Go modules in one repository if that
should become necessary.

Publishing (below) should result in the creation of a tag on the repository
if the generated artifacts are expected to be consumed downstream or by third
parties. A tag doesn’t necessarily need to be created for internal modules
such as Kubernetes ``InitContainer``s.

===== Publishing

As discussed in the <<Builds>> section, publishing will be implemented as an
optional last step/job in the regular build process. Publishing should
include any artifacts that may arise out of the build; in particular, here
are the major expected artifacts:

Go builds::
    The Go client executable and a docker image with same.
Solidity builds::
    The npm package with JSON artifacts, including deployed artifact
    information.
JS libraries::
    The npm package.
dApp builds::
    The static site publish; this may not necessarily result in an npm
    package or other directly downloadable artifact beyond a reachable URL.
InitContainer builds::
    A docker image.

For contract builds, publishing should involve deploying as well. Whether an
unpublished build includes deployment or not is a module-specific decision.

[[workflow-dispatch-event]]
===== `workflow_dispatch` event

Publishing is triggered by the `workflow_dispatch` event. These events can be
https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/[dispatched
manually], or they can be dispatched via API calls. For the purposes of this
RFC, the expectation is that first event in a chain will be dispatched
manually, and downstream builds will be fired
https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event[via
API] through intermediary Actions (see the <<Inter-module dependency management>>
below). For a module build, the `workflow_dispatch` event should
expect two parameters:

`environment`::
    The environment to run the build for. This corresponds to either a public
    testnet name (e.g. `ropsten`) or an internal environment name. `mainnet` is
    currently not a valid build identifier, as mainnet builds are currently
    run manually.
`upstream_builds`::
    A JSON array of upstream build information, in order from the original
    triggering event to the build that triggered this `workflow_dispatch`. The
    format of each object is described in the next section.

Additionally, `workflow_dispatch` events are triggered on a particular `ref`,
which is considered part of the input to the publish as well.

After a publish is successfully completed, downstream builds should be
dispatched per the following section.

==== Inter-module dependency management

Inter-module dependency management is handled by a repository that tracks
dependencies and handles inter-module and inter-repository coordination. This
repository could be an evolution of the `keep-network/local-setup` repository,
which currently manages interdependencies for local setup purposes; it could
be one or more Actions on another existing repository such as
`keep-network/keep-core`; or it could be a separate repository altogether.

The repository will have a single entry point for inter-module builds, a
GitHub Action triggered by a `workflow_dispatch` event. This event will
expect two parameters:

`environment`::
    The environment to run the build for. Same as for a module build, this
    corresponds to either a public testnet name (e.g. ropsten) or an internal
    environment name. mainnet is currently not a valid build identifier, as
    mainnet builds are currently run manually.
`upstream_builds`::
    A JSON array of upstream build information, in order from the original
    triggering event to the build that triggered this `workflow_dispatch`.

Entries in `upstream_builds` will have these properties:

`url`::
    A URL that points to the GitHub Action run in-browser.
`ref`::
    The ref used for this build.
`module`::
    The name of the module that was built, including the repository (e.g.
    `github.com/keep-network/keep-core/solidity-v1`).
`version`::
    The module version used for this build.

Downstream builds will be triggered by invoking a `workflow_dispatch` event
on their containing repository. The name provided for the event will be the
name of the build’s module followed by `.yaml`. Note that this imposes a
restriction on module build Action names: the GitHub Action associated with a
module build should match the name of the module, which should in turn match
the name of the directory the module is in. In cases where a module is nested
beyond one level in the repository, the file should be the full path, with `/`
replaced by `-`.

When invoking `workflow_dispatch` on a module, the event passed to that
module build will have these properties:

`environment`::
    The environment to run the build for. Same as for a module build, this
    corresponds to either a public testnet name (e.g. ropsten) or an internal
    environment name. mainnet is currently not a valid build identifier, as
    mainnet builds are currently run manually. This is the same as the
    parameter passed to <<oworkflow-dispatch-event,module builds>>.
`upstream-ref`::
    The ref used to trigger the upstream build. Note that this can and often
    will differ from the Action's own `ref`, which will generally be `master`
    for the dependency management repository (since typical builds will use the
    `master` branch's dependency management configuration and Action).
`upstream_builds`::
    A JSON array of upstream build information, in order from the original
    triggering event to the build that triggered this `workflow_dispatch`. This
    is the same as the parameter passed to <<workflow-dispatch-event,module
    builds>>.

The `upstream_builds` array’s latest entry will be used by the dependency
management Action to determine where in the dependency graph the upstream
build is, and trigger the appropriate downstream module builds.

This dependency management repository should track the dependencies between
builds in a way that makes them easy to resolve at runtime. A proposal would
look something like this:

```
{
    "github.com/keep-network/keep-core/solidity-v1": [
        "github.com/keep-network/keep-core",
        "github.com/keep-network/keep-core/token-dashboard"
    ],
    "github.com/keep-network/keep-core": [
        "github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa",
        "github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/solidity"
    ],
    "github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/solidity": [
        "github.com/keep-network/tbtc/solidity"
    ],
    "github.com/keep-network/tbtc/solidity": [
        "github.com/keep-network/tbtc/relay-maintainer-initcontainer",
        "github.com/keep-network/tbtc.js"
    ],
    "github.com/keep-network/tbtc.js": [
        "github.com/keep-network/tbtc-dapp",
        "github.com/keep-network/tbtc.js/liquidation-maintainer"
    ]
}
```

Here, we use the same module reference structure that we use for versioning
(the path to the module) and define downstream build dependencies, all as
JSON. When the `workflow_dispatch` event is received in the dependency
management repository, it checks the last entry in `upstream_builds` (see
below) and checks its module property against this dependency definition to
trigger the appropriate builds, done by calling the GitHub API to trigger
`workflow_dispatch` events on those repositories in turn. Note that these
builds can fan out, and this RFC does not define a "fan-in" way to trigger a
downstream only when multiple upstreams have completed.

=== Limitations

While the above proposal covers both the build/tag/publish process and defines a way to manage inter-module builds centrally, across repositories and versions, there are a few limitations to the detailed approach and a few things that are explicitly left out:

* Automated mainnet releases. Mainnet releases and upgrades currently require
  manual coordination with both internal and external entities and are still a
  topic of exploration for the team, so they are left for future work.
* Downstream builds are blocked from starting by upstream deploys. Could be a
  target of future work.
* Tracing of failures is not always straightforward: because the coordinating
  repository relies on dispatching builds on repos and having them call back to
  the coordinating repository, tracing a failure may require looking at several
  repositories to see where a build originated. The `upstream_builds` argument
  should help with this, but errors can still happen in unexpected places and
  require tracing across repositories.
* The dependency management repository can trigger fanned out builds. These
  builds will not track all `upstream_builds` entries, and could result in a
  partial downstream view of the overall build graph. Additionally, there is no
  way to specify a "fan-in" where a downstream build requires multiple upstream
  builds to complete.
* Contract artifacts will still be bundled with contract code dependencies.
  This means that a new deployment requires new artifacts and therefore a new
  npm package, and that one deployment cannot be pointed to multiple
  environments.
* Publishing builds cannot be triggered manually without navigating the GitHub
  Actions UI
** Possible fix: Heimdall can be updated to support chat- and
   GitHub-comment-based invocations of builds.

== Future Work

* When running an Action module build from a `workflow_dispatch` event, looking
  up the prior published artifact and checking whether there have been changes
  between its commit id and the current commit could be used to skip the build
  altogether and go straight to triggering downstream dependencies.
* In general, breaking the jobs down in the module builds such that rebuilds
  can be partial would allow avoiding repetition of certain slower processes in
  cases where they need not be repeated for a rebuild. It’s possible the module
  delimiting will be enough to handle this.
