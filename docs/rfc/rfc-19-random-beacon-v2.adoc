== Background

The last release of the random beacon got its genesis Sep 16th 2020 and worked
until November 11th when it was stopped with a panic button as a result of an
unannounced https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/blob/main/docs/status-reports/2020-11-11-retro-geth-hardfork.adoc[Ethereum
hard fork].

For the time it was working, the beacon produced more than 1700 relay entries
and 70 groups.

Both on-chain and off-chain components proved to be successful but - just like
with any other product - some pain points were identified by the users.
The most problematic aspects were the construction of pricing scheme and too
aggressive timeouts. This RFC aims at describing these problems and proposing
changes that should make the beacon easier to operate and more consistent with
tBTC v2.

=== ETH-based pricing

Having reimbursements for various on-chain actions in ETH was a nice feature but
also complex in practice. Highly volatile gas prices on mainnet made the gas price
ceiling value impossible to maintain up-to-date. Given that the gas price
ceiling had to be higher than the current gas price and that the fee for future
group creation was calculated based on the gas price ceiling, new groups were 
getting created too often. 

With too many groups being created, operators were spending too much ETH on
ticket submission and too low rewards were getting accumulated per group making
the reward withdrawal operation not profitable enough or not profitable at all
in the case of small stakers.

Extra submitter rewards added on top of reimbursements were hard to understand
for staking providers and calculating the providerâ€™s fee was complicated given
the non-reimbursable cost of ticket submission. Surprisingly, it is much easier
for staking providers to calculate their fee and costs in tBTC v1, having a
clean rule that no operations are reimbursed and the only reward they receive
is KEEP plus TBTC fees.

=== Aggressive timeouts

Relay entry timeouts were pretty aggressive. Set to 64x6 = 384 blocks, they were
giving about 1.5 hours to submit a relay entry before the minimum stake from each
group member was slashed. This timeout proved to be not enough to notify,
investigate, and fix a problem. Three groups were slashed in a row during the
November 11th incident that begun around 08:00 UTC, before any US-based
operators noticed the problem.


== Proposal

=== Group creation

New groups should be created with a fixed, governable frequency of relay
requests. Instead of a ticket-based approach for group selection, we should
use sortition pools. Group creation start transaction should be embedded into
relay request transaction and should lock a sortition pool. From this moment,
no operator can enter or leave the pool. Once a new relay entry appears on the
chain, all off-chain clients should perform group selection optimistically, 
using the new entry value and a view sortition pool function call.
After determining group members, clients should perform DKG as usual. 
Once the group submits the result to the chain, a challenge period starts.

During the challenge period, anyone can notify that the submitted DKG result
contains group members not selected by the pool. This leads to slashing all
members who signed the result and the notifier receives 5% from the slashed amount.
The malicious result is immediatelly discarded.
The length of the challenge period and slashing amount are governable parameters.

Once the challenge period passes, anyone can unlock the sortition pool and mark
the DKG result as accepted. In this transaction, the DKG result submitter receives
a reward, as described in <<fees-and-rewards, Fees and Rewards>> section.

There is a timeout before which DKG result should be submitted. The timeout equals
the group size multiplied by the number of blocks for a member to become eligible
to submit DKG result. The timer starts at the moment when the first member becomes
eligible.

In case the DKG result was not submitted before a timeout, anyone can notify DKG
timed out and receive a reward, as described in <<fees-and-rewards, Fees and Rewards>> 
section. DKG timeout includes the situation when no new relay entry was produced
and sortition could not be performed.

The sortition pool should weigh operators by stake and allow to select the same 
operator multiple times. DKG protocol should execute in the same way as for v1
and inactive/disqualified members should be marked and kicked out of the
sortition pool for at least 2 weeks losing their rewards for that time.

Each group created in the system remains active for the same period of time
which should be a governable parameter. Group that expired is no longer selected
for any new work and group expiration will be handled in the relay request
transaction.

[[fees-and-rewards]]
=== Fees and rewards

In tBTC v1, operators have to execute a lot of on-chain transactions per
deposit. Even though they are not reimbursed for on-chain actions and they
receive KEEP rewards and TBTC fees, this scheme proved to be successful and no
operators complained about it.

For v2 of the random beacon, all rewards should be done in T.
This scheme is compatible with tBTC v2 design where all rewards and
are also done only in T.

Relay requester should provide a fee in T. The value of the fee is a governable
parameter. The entire fee is deposited in the maintenance pool that is used to
reimburse for different actions related to DKG.

The transaction submitting relay entry is not reimbursable and implementation
should ensure the gas cost of this transaction is as low as possible, below
200k gas. The first group member eligible to submit the result is 
`new_entry MOD group_size`, then also `(new_entry MOD group_size) + 1`.
At the end, all group members should be eligible to submit the result. If the
given member did not submit the result in their round, they should be removed
from the sortition pool for at least 2 weeks and do not earn rewards for
that time. The operation removing members from the sortition pool should be
as cheap as possible so that the member submitting relay entry does not have to
pay any additional costs for removing inactive members from the pool. Smart
contract patterns such as gas station could be helpful in achieving this goal.

For example, if `new_entry MOD group_size = 60`, `group_size = 64`, and the entry 
was submitted  by the member with index `3`, members with indexes 
`{60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 1, 2}` should be removed from the sortition pool in the 
same transaction in which member with index `3` submitted relay entry.

The default time for a single member to submit a relay entry should be increased 
from 6 to 10 blocks and should become a governable parameter.

There is a fixed, governable reward for submitting a DKG result, paid from the
maintenance pool. The reward is paid to the DKG result submitter in the transaction
approving the DKG result. The logic triggering new group selection will be embedded 
in relay entry request transaction and should be as cheap as possible - it only
locks the sortition pool and emits a group creation start event.

In case the DKG result has not been submitted on time, anyone can unlock the pool
and receive a fixed, governable reward for reporting DKG timeout. The reward is
paid from the maintenance pool.

Just like in the case of relay entry submission, the order in which operators
are supposed to submit DKG result is enforced on-chain and operators who missed
their round are removed from the sortition pool for at least 2 weeks and do
not earn rewards for that time. The first member eligible to submit the DKG result
is a member with index `hash(new_group_pubkey) % group_size`, then also 
`(hash(new_group_pubkey) % group_size) + 1`. For example, if 
`hash(new_group_pubkey) % group_size = 62`, `group_size = 64`, and member `9` 
submitted DKG result, members with indexes `{62, 63, 64, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}` 
should be removed from the sortition pool in the same transaction in which 
member `9` submitted DKG result.

The default time for each member to submit DKG result should be set to 10 blocks
and should become a governable parameter.

To make this scheme work, both the relay entry and the DKG result submission
transactions need to have predictable gas costs. Although it is guaranteed for
the latter, the former, in v1 of the beacon, depends on the gas cost of
executing a callback and needs to be optimized - more on that in the
 <<callbacks,Callbacks>> section.

T rewards will be distributed continuously to all operators in the beacon
sortition pool, just like in the case of tBTC v2.

[[callbacks]]
=== Callbacks

In v1 of the random beacon, a callback is executed in the same transaction in
which relay entry is submitted with a gas limit of 2M. This allows applications
using the random beacon to avoid an additional complexity at their end but comes
at the cost of random beacon operators who need to have enough ETH on their
balance. This approach is not compatible with the idea that all rewards will be
solely in T given that it is impossible to establish the cost of executing a
callback in T.

The fact the full - even the most complex - callback is executed in the same
transaction in which the relay entry is submitted gives an impression of better
security. This impression is false though, given that the entry to be submitted
is visible in the mempool and smart attackers can have their transactions mined
faster to, for example, put the sortition pool using the entry for group
selection in the desired state. This issue needs to be solved on the sortition
pool side with initiation time for new operators in the pool and/or state lock.

Instead of executing any callback in the same transaction in which relay entry
is submitted, we should allow only simple, low gas budget callbacks with a gas
limit controlled by the governance. Applications wanting to use a relay entry
should submit another transaction using the relay entry value previously set by
the random beacon. They should also employ an additional security check making
sure the entry submitted is only valid for a certain number of blocks to avoid
the situation when relay entry beacon transaction and application-specific
transaction are executed far from each other.

Smart contract consuming new relay entry needs to implement `IRandomBeaconConsumer`
interface. Gas limit for `__beaconCallback` call should be initially set to 50k
gas which is enough to SSTORE new relay entry, block height in which the entry
was submitted, and to emit an event. Callback gas limit should be a governable
value. Failure in the callback function should not revert the relay entry
transaction. When requesting a relay entry, it should be possible to pass an
optional address parameter - this is the address of a contract implementing
`IRandomBeaconConsumer` interface that should be called when a new relay entry
is submitted to the chain.

```
interface IRandomBeaconConsumer {
    /// @notice Receives relay entry produced by Keep Random Beacon. This function
    /// should be called only by Keep Random Beacon.
    ///
    /// @param relayEntry Relay entry (random number) produced by Keep Random
    ///                   Beacon.
    /// @param blockNumber Block number at which the relay entry was submitted
    ///                    to the chain.
    function __beaconCallback(uint256 relayEntry, uint256 blockNumber) external;
}
```

=== Timeouts

We should extend the timeout for submitting relay entry to give operators more
time to react. We should extend the time for a single member to become eligible
from 6 blocks to 10 blocks and make it a governable parameter. 
After the initial timeout passes (group size multipled by the number of blocks
for a member to become eligible to submit relay entry), if no entry was
provided, all operators in the group should start bleeding and losing their
stake. The bleeding should increase linearly from 0 to the governable slashing 
amount per operator over the course of 48 hours. The time for a single group
member to become eligible to submit result and the hard relay entry timeout are
governable parameters. This gives a chance to start with more forgiving penalties
and increase them over time. In general, the slashing penalty should
be proportional to rewards and the frequency of relay requests and associated
risk.

=== Reduced complexity of contract relationships

With all changes implemented as above, we need to answer the question if the
service contract is still needed and whether we should implement a simple
beacon upgradeability scheme in the application using the beacon. In v1, the
service contract takes care of executing the callback and reimbursing the
operator. It also estimates entry fee, and determines if it is possible to
create a new group on the most recent operator contract. All these
functionalities, needed in v1, are simplified in this RFC so the service
contract may no longer be needed, and removing it from the execution path could
save some gas.
