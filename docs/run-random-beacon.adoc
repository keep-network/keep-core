= Run Random Beacon

== System Considerations

The Keep Network expects certain capabilites for each node running on the network.  To help attain
these capabilities consider the following criteria:

- It is paramount that Keep nodes remain available to the Keep Network. We strongly encourage a
  stable and redundant internet connection.
- A connection to a production grade self-hosted or third party Ethereum node deployment.
- Persistent and redundant storage that will survive a VM or container rotation, and disk failure.
- Each random beacon client running on the network requires a unique Ethereum operator account.
- Each random beacon client running on the network requires a unique IP address or a unique
  application port running under the same IP.
- Recommended machine types by provider:

|Cloud Provider
|Machine Type

|Google Cloud
|n1-standard-2

|AWS
|m5.large

|Azure
|D2s v3

== Configuration

=== Network

Default port mappings.

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Egress
|Port

|Ethereum Network
|`8545` / `8546`

|Keep Network
|`3919`
|===

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Ingress
|Port

|Keep Network
|`3919`
|===

If you set a different `port` in your keep-client configuration, or configure `peers` with
non-default ports configured, firewall rules will need to be adjusted accordingly.

=== Application

Application configurations are stored in a `.toml` file and passed to the application run command
 with the `--config` flag.

==== Sample

```
# Ethereum host connection info.
[ethereum]
  URL = "ws://127.0.0.1:8546"
  URLRPC = "http://127.0.0.1:8545"

# Keep operator Ethereum account.
[ethereum.account]
  Address = "0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8AAAAAAAAA"
  KeyFile = "/Users/someuser/ethereum/data/keystore/UTC--2018-03-11T01-37-33.202765887Z--AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8AAAAAAAAA"

# Keep contract addresses configuration.
[ethereum.ContractAddresses]
  # Hex-encoded address of KeepRandomBeaconOperator contract
  KeepRandomBeaconOperator = "0xBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
  # Hex-encoded address of TokenStaking contract
  TokenStaking = "0xCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC"
  # Hex-encoded address of KeepRandomBeaconService contract. Only needed
  # in cases where the client's utility functions will be used (e.g., the
  # relay subcommand).
  KeepRandomBeaconService = "0xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"

# Keep network configuration.
[LibP2P]
  Peers = ["/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/3919/ipfs/njOXcNpVTweO3fmX72OTgDX9lfb1AYiiq4BN6Da1tFy9nT3sRT2h1", "/dns4/some-keep-host.com/tcp/3919/ipfs/njOXcNpVTweO3fmX72OTgDX9lfb1AYiiq4BN6Da1tFy9nT3sRT2h1"]
  Port  = 3920
  # Override the node's default addresses announced in the network
  AnnouncedAddresses = ["/dns4/example.com/tcp/3919", "/ip4/80.70.60.50/tcp/3919"]

# Storage is encrypted
[Storage]
  DataDir = "/my/secure/location"

== Build from Source

See the https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/master/docs/development#building[building] section in our developer docs.

== Docker

=== Get Image

Doesn't exist for the public yet.

=== Run Image
This is a sample run command for illustration purposes only.

```
export KEEP_CLIENT_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD=$(cat .secrets/eth-account-password.txt)
export KEEP_CLIENT_CONFIG_DIR=$(pwd)/config
export KEEP_CLIENT_PERSISTENCE_DIR=$(pwd)/persistence

docker run -dit \
--volume $KEEP_CLIENT_PERSISTENCE_DIR:/mnt/keep-client/persistence \
--volume $KEEP_CLIENT_CONFIG_DIR:/mnt/keep-client/config \
--env KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD=$KEEP_CLIENT_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD \
--env LOG_LEVEL=debug \
-p 3919:3919 \
keep-client --config /mnt/keep-client/config/keep-client-config.toml start
```

== Deployment Considerations

=== Kubernetes

At Keep we run on GCP + Kube. To accommodate the aforementioned system considerations we use the following pattern for each of our environments:

- Regional Kube cluster.
- 5 beacon clients, each running minimum stake required by the network.
- A LoadBalancer Service for each client.
- A StatefulSet for each client.

You can see our Ropsten Kube configurations https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/master/infrastructure/kube/keep-test[here]

== Logging

Below are some of the key things to look out for to make sure you're booted and connected to the
network:

=== Configurable Values

```
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
IPFS_LOGGING_FMT=nocolor
GOLOG_FILE=/var/log/keep/keep.log
GOLOG_TRACING_FILE=/var/log/keep/trace.json

**Bonus**: If you want to share your LibP2P address with others you can get it from the startup log.  When sharing remember to substitute the `/ipv4/` address with the public facing IP of your client if you're running on a private machine, or replace the entire `/ipv4/` segment with a DNS entry if you're using a hostname.

=== Testnet

Keep uses the Ethereum Ropsten Testnet.

==== Faucet

The KEEP faucet will will issue a 300k KEEP token grant for the provided Ethereum account.  You can
use the faucet from your web browser or via a terminal using curl.

Faucet Endpoint: https://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten

To use the faucet you need to pass your Ethereum account to the faucet endpoint with the parameter
`?account=<eth-account-address>`.

Curl Example:
```
curl 'https://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten?account=0x0eC14BC7cCA82c942Cf276F6BbD0413216dDB2bE'
```

Browser Example:
```
https://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten?account=0x0eC14BC7cCA82c942Cf276F6BbD0413216dDB2bE
```

Once you've got your KEEP token grant you can manage it with our https://dashboard.test.keep.network[token dashboard].

== Staking

=== Terminology

address:: Hexadecimal string consisting of 40 characters prefixed with "0x" uniquely identifying Ethereum account; 
derived from ECDSA public key of the party. Example address: `0xb2560a01e4b8b5cb0ac549fa39c7ae255d80e943`.

owner:: The address owning KEEP tokens or KEEP token grant. The owner’s participation is not required in the day-to-day 
operations on the stake, so cold storage can be accommodated to the maximum extent.

operator:: The address of a party authorized to operate in the network on behalf of a given owner. The operator handles 
the everyday operations on the delegated stake without actually owning the staked tokens. An operator can not simply 
transfer away delegated tokens, however, it should be noted that operator's misbehaviour may result in slashing tokens 
and thus the entire staked amount is indeed at stake.

beneficiary:: the address where the rewards for participation and all reimbursements are sent, earned by an operator, 
on behalf of an owner

delegated stake:: an owner's staked tokens, delegated to the operator by the owner. Delegation enables KEEP owners to 
have their wallets offline and their stake operated by operators on their behalf.

operator contract:: Ethereum smart contract handling operations that may have an impact on staked tokens.

authorizer:: the address appointed by owner to authorize operator contract on behalf of the owner. Operator contract 
must be pre-approved by authorizer before the operator is eligible to use it and join the specific part of the network.

=== Delegating tokens

KEEP tokens are delegated by the owner. During the delegation, the owner needs to appoint an operator, beneficiary, 
and authorizer. Owner may delegate owned tokens or tokens from a grant. Owner may decide to delegate just a portion 
of owned tokens or just a part of tokens from a grant. Owner may delegate multiple times to different operators. 
Tokens can be delegated using Tokens page in https://dashboard.test.keep.network[KEEP token dashboard] and a certain minimum stake defined by the system is required to be provided in the delegation. The more stake is delegated, the higher chance to be selected to relay group.

Delegation takes immediate effect but can be cancelled within one week without additional delay. After one week 
operator appointed during the delegation becomes eligible for work selection.

=== Authorizations
Before operator is considered as eligible for work selection, authorizer appointed during the delegation needs to review 
and authorize Keep Random Beacon smart contract. Smart contracts can be authorized using KEEP token dashboard. Authorized operator contracts may slash or seize tokens in case of operator's misbehavior.
