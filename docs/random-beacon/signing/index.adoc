= Random Beacon Signing

Entries are produced as customers submit requests.
Details of making requests are in _RFC 16: Pricing_.

When a request for a new entry is received,
the previous entry _Entry~i-1~_ is used
to select the signing group _Group~i~_
which then produces a threshold BLS signature for the previous entry:
_Entry~i~ = blsSign(blsPrivkey(Group~i~), Entry~i-1~)_.
