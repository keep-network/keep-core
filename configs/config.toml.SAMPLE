# Uncomment to override the defaults for transaction status monitoring.

# MiningCheckInterval is the interval in which transaction
# mining status is checked. If the transaction is not mined within this
# time, the gas price is increased and transaction is resubmitted.
#
# MiningCheckInterval = 60  # 60 sec (default value)

# MaxGasFeeCap specifies the maximum gas fee cap the client is
# willing to pay for the transaction to be mined. The offered transaction
# gas cost can not be higher than the max gas fee cap value. If the maximum
# allowed gas fee cap is reached, no further resubmission attempts are
# performed. This property should be set only for Ethereum. In case of
# legacy non-EIP-1559 transactions, this field works in the same way as
# `MaxGasPrice` property.

# MaxGasFeeCap = "500 Gwei" # 500 Gwei (default value)

# Uncomment to enable Ethereum node rate limiting. Both properties can be
# used together or separately.

# per second which can be executed against the Ethereum node.
# All types of Ethereum node requests are rate-limited,
# including view function calls.

# ConcurrencyLimit sets the maximum number of concurrent requests which
# can be executed against the Ethereum node at the same time.
# This limit affects all types of Ethereum node requests,
# including view function calls.
#
# ConcurrencyLimit = 30

# BalanceAlertThreshold defines a minimum value of the operator's account
# balance below which the client will start reporting errors in logs.
# A value can be provided in `wei`, `Gwei` or `ether`, e.g. `7.5 ether`,
# `7500000000 Gwei`.
#
# BalanceAlertThreshold = "0.5 ether" # 0.5 ether (default value)
