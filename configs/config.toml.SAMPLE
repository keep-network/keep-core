	# mining status is checked. If the transaction is not mined within this
	# time, the gas price is increased and transaction is resubmitted.

	# MaxGasPrice specifies the default maximum gas price the client is
	# willing to pay for the transaction to be mined. The offered transaction
	# gas price can not be higher than the max gas price value. If the maximum
	# allowed gas price is reached, no further resubmission attempts are
