/**
 * The group selection protocol is an interactive method of selecting candidate
 * group from the set of all stakers given a pseudorandom seed value.
 *
 * The protocol produces a representative result, where each staker's profit is
 * proportional to the number of tokens they have staked. Produced candidate
 * groups are of constant size.
 *
 * Group selection protocol accepts seed as an input - a pseudorandom value
 * used to construct candidate tickets. Each candidate group member can
 * submit their tickets. The maximum number of tickets one can submit depends
 * on their staking weight - relation of the minimum stake to the candidate's
 * stake.
 *
 * There is a certain timeout, expressed in blocks, when tickets can be
 * submitted. Each ticket is a mix of staker's address, virtual staker index
 * and group selection seed. Candidate group members are selected based on
 * the best tickets submitted. There has to be a minimum number of tickets
 * submitted, equal to the candidate group size so that the protocol can
 * complete successfully.
