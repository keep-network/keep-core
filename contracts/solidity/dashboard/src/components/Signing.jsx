                <p>
                    To become an operator you must have a mutual agreement with the stake owner. This is achieved by creating
                    a signature of the stake owner address and sending it to the owner. Using the signature the owner can initiate
                    stake delegation and you will be able to participate in network operations on behalf of the stake owner.
