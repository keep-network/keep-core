/*
  This script provides friendly interface to manage stake for development purposes.

  To stake KEEP tokens, use 'stake' command and provide three parameters:
  - operator address
  - amount of KEEP to stake
  - KEEP owner address (we assume it's also magpie/beneficiary address)

    $ truffle exec scripts/manage-stake.js stake 0x524f2E0176350d950fA630D9A5a59A0a190DAf48 10000 0xFa3DA235947AaB49D439f3BcB46effD1a7237E32

  To initiate unstake, use 'initiate-unstake' command and provide two parameters:
  - operator address
  - amount of KEEP to unstake

    $ truffle exec scripts/manage-stake.js initiate-unstake 0x524f2E0176350d950fA630D9A5a59A0a190DAf48 100

  To finish unstaking, use 'finish-unstake' command and provide operator address
  as a parameter. Please bear in mind you may need to wait for the expected 
  withdrawal delay time to be able to finish unstaking.

    $ truffle exec scripts/manage-stake.js finish-unstake 0x524f2E0176350d950fA630D9A5a59A0a190DAf48

  To print information about the stake, use 'print-stake' command and provide
  operator address as a parameter.

    $ truffle exec scripts/manage-stake.js print-stake 0x524f2E0176350d950fA630D9A5a59A0a190DAf48
