= Run Random Beacon

== System Considerations

The Keep Network expects certain capabilities for each node running on the network.  To help attain
these capabilities consider the following criteria:

- It is paramount that Keep nodes remain available to the Keep Network. We strongly encourage a
  stable and redundant internet connection.
- A connection to a production grade self-hosted or third party Ethereum node deployment.
- Persistent and redundant storage that will survive a VM or container rotation, and disk failure.
- Each random beacon client running on the network requires a unique Ethereum operator account.
- Each random beacon client running on the network requires a unique IP address or a unique
  application port running under the same IP.
- Recommended machine types by provider:

Your operating environment will ultimately dictate what machine type to go with.  This is
particularly relevant if you're running a containerized solution where multiple applications
are sharing VM resources.  The below types are sufficient for running at least one instance of the
Keep Random Beacon client.

|===
|Cloud Provider
|Machine Type

|Google Cloud
|n1-standard-2

|AWS
|t3.medium

|Azure
|A2 v2

|Self-hosted
|2 vCPU / 4 GiB RAM / 1 GiB Persistent Storage
|===

== Gas Costs

Random Beacon smart contracts reimburse the operator for successfully submitting relay entry
and DKG result but they do not reimburse for submitting a group selection ticket. Reimbursements
are sent to the beneficiary account and can be claimed along with rewards once the group expires.
It is expected that the operators have enough ETH on the accounts used by clients to submit the
required transactions and that the operator account balance is monitored and refilled as needed.
Bear in mind that the higher stake is, the operator is selected more frequently and is expected
to submit more transactions as a result.

Below is the average gas cost of the most important transactions the client is submitting:

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|TX
|Gas Cost
|Reimbursed

|Submit group selection ticket
|140 000
|No

|Submit DKG result
|1 740 000
|Yes

|Submit relay entry
|280 000
|Yes
|===

For example, if the operator has 10 x minimum stake, it can submit 10 tickets. If the operator has
been selected to the group with index 1, it is expected to submit DKG result and every relay entry
the group will produce. Assuming the group produces 100 entries, the cost for the operator is
`(10 * 140 000 + 1 740 000 + 100 * 280 000) * gas_price` ETH. It means that the operator needs to
have on their account:

- For the gas price of 20 Gwei, at least 0.6228 ETH. 
- For the gas price of 100 Gwei, at least 3.114 ETH. 
- For the gas price of 800 Gwei, at least 24.912 ETH. 

It is paramount that the operator accounts have some safety margin and consider the current gas price
and stake when funding their accounts.

== Configuration

=== Network

Default port mappings.

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Egress
|Port

|Ethereum Network
|`8545` / `8546`

|Keep Network
|`3919`
|===

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Ingress
|Port

|Keep Network
|`3919`
|===

If you set a different `port` in your keep-client configuration, or configure `peers` with
non-default ports configured, firewall rules will need to be adjusted accordingly.

=== Application

Application configurations are stored in a `.toml` file and passed to the application run command
 with the `--config` flag.

== Deployment Considerations

=== Kubernetes

At Keep we run on GCP + Kube. To accommodate the aforementioned system considerations we use the following pattern for each of our environments:

- Regional Kube cluster.
- 5 beacon clients, each running minimum stake required by the network.
- A LoadBalancer Service for each client.
- A StatefulSet for each client.

You can see our Ropsten Kube configurations link:../infrastructure/kube/keep-test[here]

== Logging

Below are some of the key things to look out for to make sure you're booted and connected to the
network:

**Bonus**: If you want to share your LibP2P address with others you can get it from the startup log.  When sharing remember to substitute the `/ipv4/` address with the public facing IP of your client if you're running on a private machine, or replace the entire `/ipv4/` segment with a DNS entry if you're using a hostname.

=== Testnet

Keep uses the Ethereum Ropsten Testnet.

==== Faucet

The KEEP faucet will will issue a 300k KEEP token grant for the provided Ethereum account.  You can
use the faucet from your web browser or via a terminal using curl.

Faucet Endpoint: https://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten

To use the faucet you need to pass your Ethereum account to the faucet endpoint with the parameter
`?account=<eth-account-address>`.

Curl Example:
[source,bash]
----
curl 'https://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten?account=0x0eC14BC7cCA82c942Cf276F6BbD0413216dDB2bE'
----

Browser Example:
```
https://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten?account=0x0eC14BC7cCA82c942Cf276F6BbD0413216dDB2bE
```

Once you've got your KEEP token grant you can manage it with our https://dashboard.test.keep.network[token dashboard].

==== Bootstrap Peers

Bootstrap peers will come and go on testnet.  As long as at least one of your configured peers is
up, there is no need to worry.

== Metrics

The client exposes the following metrics:

- connected peers count,
- connected bootstraps count,
- Ethereum client connectivity status (if a simple read-only CALL can be executed).

Metrics can be enabled in the configuration `.toml` file. It is possible to customize port at which
metrics endpoint is exposed as well as the frequency with which the metrics are collected.

Exposed metrics contain the value and timestamp at which they were collected.

Example metrics endpoint call result:
```
$ curl localhost:9601/metrics
# TYPE connected_peers_count gauge
connected_peers_count 108 1623235129569

# TYPE connected_bootstrap_count gauge
connected_bootstrap_count 10 1623235129569

# TYPE eth_connectivity gauge
eth_connectivity 1 1623235129789
```

== Diagnostics

The client exposes the following diagnostics:

- list of connected peers along with their network id and Ethereum operator address,
- information about the client's network id and Ethereum operator address.

Diagnostics can be enabled in the configuration `.toml` file. It is possible to customize port at which
diagnostics endpoint is exposed.

Example diagnostics endpoint call result:
```
$ curl localhost:9501/diagnostics
{
  "client_info" { 
   "ethereum_address":"0xDcd4199e22d09248cA2583cBDD2759b2acD22381",

== Staking

=== Terminology

address:: Hexadecimal string consisting of 40 characters prefixed with "0x" uniquely identifying Ethereum account;
derived from ECDSA public key of the party. Example address: `0xb2560a01e4b8b5cb0ac549fa39c7ae255d80e943`.

owner:: The address owning KEEP tokens or KEEP token grant. The owner’s participation is not required in the day-to-day
operations on the stake, so cold storage can be accommodated to the maximum extent.

operator:: The address of a party authorized to operate in the network on behalf of a given owner. The operator handles
the everyday operations on the delegated stake without actually owning the staked tokens. An operator can not simply
transfer away delegated tokens, however, it should be noted that operator's misbehaviour may result in slashing tokens
and thus the entire staked amount is indeed at stake.

beneficiary:: the address where the rewards for participation and all reimbursements are sent, earned by an operator,
on behalf of an owner

delegated stake:: an owner's staked tokens, delegated to the operator by the owner. Delegation enables KEEP owners to
have their wallets offline and their stake operated by operators on their behalf.

operator contract:: Ethereum smart contract handling operations that may have an impact on staked tokens.

authorizer:: the address appointed by owner to authorize operator contract on behalf of the owner. Operator contract
must be pre-approved by authorizer before the operator is eligible to use it and join the specific part of the network.

=== Delegating tokens

KEEP tokens are delegated by the owner. During the delegation, the owner needs to appoint an operator, beneficiary,
and authorizer. Owner may delegate owned tokens or tokens from a grant. Owner may decide to delegate just a portion
of owned tokens or just a part of tokens from a grant. Owner may delegate multiple times to different operators.
Tokens can be delegated using Tokens page in https://dashboard.test.keep.network[KEEP token dashboard] and a certain minimum stake defined by the system is required to be provided in the delegation. The more stake is delegated, the higher chance to be selected to relay group.

Delegation takes immediate effect but can be cancelled within 12 hours without additional delay. After 12 hours
operator appointed during the delegation becomes eligible for work selection.

=== Authorizations
Before operator is considered as eligible for work selection, authorizer appointed during the delegation needs to review
and authorize Keep Random Beacon smart contract. Smart contracts can be authorized using KEEP token dashboard. Authorized operator contracts may slash or seize tokens in case of operator's misbehavior.
