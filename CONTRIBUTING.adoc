= Keep Contribution Guide

ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ Contributions are welcome from
anyone on the internet, and even the smallest of fixes are appreciated!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Keep and its packages.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

== Getting started

1. Fork https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core[`keep-network/keep-core`]
2. Clone your fork
3. Follow the
   https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/main/docs/development[installation
   & build steps] in the developer documentation.
4. Set up the <<Development Tooling>>.
5. Open a PR against the `main` branch and describe the change you
   are intending to undertake in the PR description.

Before marking the PR as ready for review, make sure:

* It passes the linter checks (`npm run lint`) (see <<Pre-commit>> to make this
  automatic).
* It passes the https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/actions[continuous
  integration tests].
* Your changes have sufficient test coverage (e.g regression tests have
  been added for bug fixes, unit tests for new features)

== Development Tooling

Commits
https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-commit-signature-verification[must
be signed].

=== Continuous Integration

Keep uses https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/actions[Github Actions] for
continuous integration. All jobs must be green to merge a PR.

=== Pre-commit

Pre-commit is a tool to install hooks that check code before commits are made.
It can be helpful to install this, to automatically run linter checks and avoid
pushing code that will not be accepted. Follow the
https://pre-commit.com/[installation instructions here], and then run
`pre-commit install` to install the hooks. Note that the
`scripts/macos-setup.sh` script should automatically set this up for you.

=== Linting

Linters and formatters for Solidity, JavaScript, and Go code are set up and run
automatically as part of pre-commit hooks. These are checked again in CI builds
to ensure they have been run and are passing.

If you want to change a rule, or add a custom rule, to the JavaScript or
Solidity linting, please propose these changes to our
https://github.com/keep-network/solium-config-keep[solium-config-keep] and
https://github.com/keep-network/eslint-config-keep[eslint-config-keep] packages.
All other packages have it as a dependency.
