# Overview

This is a tool for finding KEEP token owners on Ethereum (or on any other 
EVM-compatible chain). It will walk over predefined sources of truth
(information) and lookup KEEP token owners at a specific block number.
The tool generates a Merkle tree used as an input to
https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/blob/master/solidity/contracts/token-distribution/TokenDistributor.sol[`TokenDistributor`]
contract airdropping another ERC20 token with amounts based on KEEP token 
balances. 

# Sources of truth

Holders of the tokens can be externally owned accounts or contracts. It is
necessary to resolve actual owner of tokens held by a contract.

Following sources are currently defined:

- <<KEEP Token>> contract,
- <<Token Staking>> contracts,
- <<Token Grant and Token Staking Escrow>> contracts,
- <<Liquidity Rewards>> contracts,
- <<KEEP-only pool>> contract.

The list of supported sources of truth can be enhanced. For guidelines on 
implementing additional sources please see <<Development>> section.


## KEEP Token

Scans `KeepToken` contract (`0x85Eee30c52B0b379b046Fb0F85F4f3Dc3009aFEC`) 
for any accounts that have ever held KEEP tokens. Iterates over the set of
addresses and checks KEEP token balance at the specific target block.

To avoid duplication with results of lookups of other sources of truth, it ignores
addresses of contracts handled by them. For the ignored contract addresses, separate
sources of truth are implemented. For example, Token Grant and Token Staking
contract addresses are ignored as the actual owners of KEEP tokens
locked in these contracts are resolved separately by <<Token Staking>> and 
<<Token Grant and Token Staking Escrow>> sources.

## Token Staking

Scans old `TokenStaking` (`0x6D1140a8c8e6Fac242652F0a5A8171b898c67600`) and new 
`TokenStaking` (`0x1293a54e160D1cd7075487898d65266081A15458`) contracts for any
historic stakes to determine amount of tokens still locked in them. Ignores tokens
staked from grants as those are resolved by <<Token Grant and Token Staking Escrow>>
source.

## Token Grant and Token Staking Escrow

Scans `TokenGrant` contract (`0x175989c71Fd023D580C65F5dC214002687ff88B7`) for 
grant holders  and their balances. Scans `TokenStakingEscrow` contract 
(`0xDa534b567099Ca481384133bC121D5843F681365`) for undelegated grant stakes, their
owners and balances. The final balance is calculated as a total grant amount minus
withdrawn, revoked, and slashed tokens.

Note that `TokenStakingEscrow` holds tokens from undelegated stakes that were
created from grants. Tokens from stakes created from liquid tokens and undelegated,
come back to the owner address and are covered by <<KEEP Token>> source of truth.

## Liquidity Rewards

Scans for `Staked` events in the KEEP-ETH (`0x47A5f2ffdf66D13ED7e317581F458d09b49d6F44`)
and KEEP-TBTC (`0xb3d03A5411261fC2094697C5e969D552eE55cF6B`) LP Reward contracts. It
finds all the staker addresses and their LP balances staked in these contracts 
at the provided target block (`balanceOf` function). KEEP locked amount is calculated 
for each staker proportionally based on their staked LP tokens and KEEP token reserve
held by the pool.

## KEEP-only pool

Scans for `Staked` events in the `KeepVault` contract (`0xdF00daC2Be1250cF62cBFc617EE7bC45C0016c87`).
It retrieves all the historical staker addresses and resolves amounts of KEEP tokens
staked by them at the provided target block (`balanceOf` function).

# How to run

## Prerequisites

1. It requires node version greater than `14`: `nvm use 14`.

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.

## Execution

Following environment variables are expected to be configured:

- `ETH_HOSTNAME` (required) - URL for Ethereum API

Following arguments are expected by the program:

- `target-block` (required) - block at which calculations should be made

Command example:

```sh
ETH_HOSTNAME="wss://eth-mainnet.ws.alchemyapi.io/v2/....." \
  ./bin/inspect-token-ownership.js --target-block 10000000
```

# Development

New truth of sources can be added by extending `ITruthSource` class. The new class
should implement `getTokenHoldingsAtTargetBlock` function that will return
a map of token holding. The source of truth should be registered with 
`registerTruthSource` function.

It's important that sources of truth do not duplicate the balances, when
a holding can occur in few of them. E.g. when an owner staked tokens from a grant
we could end up with duplications in TokenStaking and TokenGrant. To handle such
situation we ignore any non externally owned accounts in TokenStaking.

# Known Issues

## error: artifact does not define network *

Web3 provider may return invalid results for `getChainId()` function. The error
looks like on this example:
```
debug: chain id: 11927526
error: artifact does not define network 11927526
```

As a workaround rerun the script.
