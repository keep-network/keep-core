	// HistoryDepth is the number of blocks to look back from the current block

	// for which the SPV proof should be submitted, the maintainer first inspects
	// the appropriate type of wallet-related events. This depth determines how
	// far into the past the system will consider events for processing. This
	// value must not be too high so that the event lookup is efficient. At the
	// same time, this value can not be too low to make sure all performed and
	// not yet proven transactions can be found.

	// TransactionLimit sets the maximum number of confirmed transactions
	// returned when getting transactions for a public key hash. Once the
	// maintainer establishes the list of wallets, it needs to check Bitcoin
	// transactions executed by each wallet. Then, it tries to find the
	// transactions matching the given proposal type. For example, if set
	// to `20`, only the latest twenty transactions will be returned. This
	// value must not be too high so that the transaction lookup is efficient.
	// At the same time, this value can not be too low to make sure the
	// performed proposal's transaction can be found in case the wallet decided
	// to execute some other Bitcoin transaction after the yet-not-proven
	// transaction.
