	// HistoryDepth is the number of blocks to look back from the current block

	// To find Bitcoin transactions for which the SPV proof should be submitted,
	// the maintainer first inspects the proposal events from the wallet
	// coordinator contract. This depth determines how far into the past the
	// system will consider events for processing. This value must not be too
	// high so that the event lookup is efficient. At the same time, this value
	// can not be too low to make sure all performed and not yet proven
	// transactions can be found.

	// TransactionLimit sets the maximum number of confirmed transactions
	// returned when getting transactions for a public key hash. Once the
	// maintainer establishes the list of proposals of given type, based on the
	// proposal submission events from the wallet coordinator contract, it needs
	// to check Bitcoin transactions executed by the wallet. Then, it tries to
	// find the transactions matching the given proposal type. For example, if set
	// to `20`, only the latest twenty transactions will be returned. This
	// value must not be too high so that the transaction lookup is efficient.
	// At the same time, this value can not be too low to make sure the
	// performed proposal's transaction can be found in case the wallet decided
	// to execute some other Bitcoin transaction after the yet-not-proven
	// transaction.
