// generateTickets generates a set of tickets for the given staker and relay
// entry value given the specified stake parameters and natural threshold.
// It returns the tickets in two slices:
// - initialSubmissionTickets contains tickets with values below the natural
//   threshold. These tickets should be submitted first as they have the highest
//   chance of being selected to the group.
// - reactiveSubmissionTickets contains tickets with values equal to or above
//   the natural threshold. These tickets should be submitted in the reactive
//   submission phase if there is still a chance to become a group member.
//
// Tickets are returned sorted in ascending order by their value.
