// Package thresholdgroup contains the code that implements threshold key
// generation and signing using BLS for members of groups of arbitrary size. It
// consists of a series of structs that represent the various states of a member
// of a threshold group, from an uninitialized member to a member that has a
// valid private share of a group key and can perform threshold signatures.
//
// thresholdgroup.NewMember creates a new LocalMember with a given id, which
// will participate in a group of a set size with a specified threshold. Each
// following struct (SharingMember, JustifyingMember, and Member) represents a
// following phase of distributed key generation.
//
// This package does not implement any synchronization or network operations;
// instead, it is meant to be the core implementation of distributed key
// generation and threshold signing, and can be plugged into separate sync
// and/or networking setups. This also means that none of the underlying
// implementation in this package is thread-safe.
//
// The distributed key generation approach is based on [GJKR 99], which in turn
// relies partially on the verifiable secret sharing approach in [Ped91b].
// References throughout the code are to these papers.

// High-level description with 3 players. Note that in practice 3 players would
// mean our threshold could be at most 1, so we would only operate with 1
// coefficient. We do 3 players and threshold equals 2 for explanatory purposes:
//
// Take 3 players. Each generates a random polynomial of `dishonestThreshold` degree:
//
// f_1(x) = a_10 + a_11 x + a_12 x^2
// f_2(x) = a_20 + a_21 x + a_22 x^2
// f_3(x) = a_30 + a_31 x + a_32 x^2
//
// Each player broadcasts an array of commitments `g^<coefficient>` to all players:
//
// 1: [g^{a_10}, g^{a_11}, g^{a_12}]
// 2: [g^{a_20}, g^{a_22}, g^{a_22}]
// 3: [g^{a_30}, g^{a_32}, g^{a_32}]
//
// Each player i then sends a private share s_ij to each other player j,
// s_ij = f_i(j):
//
//        |             1                |             2                |             3                |
//    1   | a_10 + a_11 (1) + a_12 (1)^2 | a_10 + a_11 (2) + a_12 (2)^2 | a_10 + a_11 (3) + a_12 (3)^2 |
//    2   | a_20 + a_21 (1) + a_22 (1)^2 | a_20 + a_21 (2) + a_22 (2)^2 | a_20 + a_21 (3) + a_22 (3)^2 |
//    3   | a_30 + a_31 (1) + a_32 (1)^2 | a_30 + a_31 (2) + a_32 (2)^2 | a_30 + a_31 (3) + a_32 (3)^2 |
//
// Each player can verify their private share against the commitments by raising
// the g to the private share s_ij and checking that:
//
//   g^{s_ij} = (g^{a_i0})^j^0 · (g^{a_i1})^j^1 · (g^{a_i2})^j^2
//
// This is because:
//
//   g^{s_ij} = g^{a_i0 + a_i1 j + a_i2 j^2}
//            = g^{a_i0} · g^{a_i1 j} · g^{a_i2 j^2}
//
// Unverified shares are accused, and the players in question have the
// opportunity to justify themselves. All players with valid shares at the end
// are part of the qualified set, and are the only players considered after this
// point.
//
// With each share `g^{s_ij}`, each player can now recover g raised to the power
// of the zero coefficient of every other player, `g^{a_i0}`. These are the
// shares of the group public key, and can be combined by multiplying all of
// them into the complete group public key.
//
// Each player i's final share of the group private key is then the sum of the
// private shares they received from other players. For player 1, for example,
// this is s_11 + s_12 + s_13 = f_1(1) + f_2(1) + f_3(1). Note that the group
// private key is the sum of all of the players' zero coefficients, `a_i0`, but
// we don't have enough information at this stage for any given player to be
// able to recover this group private key, so only by collaborating can the
// players make use of it.
//
// PS: All of this is mod math. Private shares and keys are done mod q, public
// shares and keys are done mod p.
