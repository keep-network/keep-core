// signerGroup represents a state of a signing group for each protocol execution.
//
// Number of members at the beginning of execution is equal to a preconfigured value,
// specific for each group, represented by `InitialGroupSize`.
// Misbehaving or not responding members are removed from the group.
//
// The actual number of members in the group cannot fall under the `Threshold`
// value. If it does, the protocol execution will be aborted. The `Threshold` is
// a preconfigured value, specific for each group.
//
// Initial group is set by the group selection protocol. A fresh list of members
// is selected before key generation process execution, where ECDSA key shares are
// distributed among group members. Hence for the signing part of the protocol the
// group must be fixed. New members cannot join the group after the ECDSA key
// shares are distributed.
//
// Defines also what is an initial size of the group and what is a threshold for
// signing.

	// If we consider an honest-but-curious adversary, i.e. an adversary that
	// learns all the secret data of compromised server but does not change
	// their code, then [GGN 16] protocol produces signature with `n = t + 1`
	// players in the network (since all players will behave honestly, even the
	// corrupted ones).
	// But in the presence of a malicious adversary, who can force corrupted
	// players to shut down or send incorrect messages, one needs at least
	// `n = 2t + 1` players in total to guarantee robustness, i.e. the ability
	// to generate signatures even in the presence of malicious faults.
	//
	// Threshold is just for signing. If anything goes wrong during key
	// generation, e.g. one of ZKPs fails or any commitment opens incorrectly,
	// key generation protocol terminates without an output.
