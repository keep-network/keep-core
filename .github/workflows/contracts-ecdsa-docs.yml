  # This job will be triggered for PRs which modify contracts. It will generate

  # The job will also be run after manual triggering and after pushes to the
  # `releases/mainnet/solidity/**` branches if there were changes to the

  # This job will be triggered for releases which name starts with

  # Markdown and sync it with a specific path of
  # `threshold-network/threshold` repository. If changes will be detected,
  # a PR updating the docs will be created in the destination repository. The
  # commit pushing the changes will be verified using GPG key.
