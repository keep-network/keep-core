/// @title Group Selection
/// @notice The group selection protocol is an interactive method of selecting
/// candidate group from the set of all stakers given a pseudorandom seed value.
///
/// The protocol produces a representative result, where each staker's profit is
/// proportional to the number of tokens they have staked. Produced candidate
/// groups are of constant size.
///
/// Group selection protocol accepts seed as an input - a pseudorandom value
/// used to construct candidate tickets. Each candidate group member can
/// submit their tickets. The maximum number of tickets one can submit depends
/// on their staking weight - relation of the minimum stake to the candidate's
/// stake.
///
/// There is a certain timeout, expressed in blocks, when tickets can be
/// submitted. Each ticket is a mix of staker's address, virtual staker index
/// and group selection seed. Candidate group members are selected based on
/// the best tickets submitted. There has to be a minimum number of tickets
/// submitted, equal to the candidate group size so that the protocol can
/// complete successfully.
