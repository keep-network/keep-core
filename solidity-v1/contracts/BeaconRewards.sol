/// The amount of KEEP to be distributed is determined by funding the contract,
/// and additional KEEP can be added at any time.
///
/// When an interval is over, it will be allocated a percentage of the remaining
/// unallocated rewards based on its weight, and adjusted by the number of groups
/// created in the interval if the quota is not met.
///
/// The adjustment for not meeting the group quota is a percentage that equals
/// the percentage of the quota that was met; if the number of groups created is
/// 80% of the quota then 80% of the base reward will be allocated for the
/// interval.

/// Any unallocated rewards will stay in the unallocated rewards pool,
/// to be allocated for future intervals. Intervals past the initially defined
/// schedule have a weight of 100%, meaning that all remaining unallocated
/// rewards will be allocated to the interval.

/// and the group has been marked as stale.
/// There is no time limit to receiving rewards, nor is there need to wait for
