/*
  This script provides friendly interface to manage stake for development purposes.

  To stake KEEP tokens, use 'stake' command and provide three parameters:
  - operator address
  - amount of KEEP to stake
  - KEEP owner address (we assume it's also beneficiary/authorizer address)

    $ truffle exec scripts/manage-stake.js stake 0x524f2E0176350d950fA630D9A5a59A0a190DAf48 10000 0xFa3DA235947AaB49D439f3BcB46effD1a7237E32

  To undelegate, use 'undelegate' command and provide operator address as a parameter

    $ truffle exec scripts/manage-stake.js undelegate 0x524f2E0176350d950fA630D9A5a59A0a190DAf48

  To recover stake, use 'recover-stake' command and provide operator address
  as a parameter. Please bear in mind you may need to wait for the expected 
  undelegation period time to be able to recover stake.

    $ truffle exec scripts/manage-stake.js recover-stake 0x524f2E0176350d950fA630D9A5a59A0a190DAf48

  To print information about the stake, use 'print-stake' command and provide
  operator address as a parameter.

    $ truffle exec scripts/manage-stake.js print-stake 0x524f2E0176350d950fA630D9A5a59A0a190DAf48
