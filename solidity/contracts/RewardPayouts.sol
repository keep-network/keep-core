/// @title KEEP Signer Subsidy Rewards
/// @notice A contract for distributing KEEP token rewards to keeps.
/// When a reward contract is created, the creator defines a reward schedule
/// consisting of one or more reward intervals and their interval weights,
/// the length of reward intervals, and the quota of how many keeps must be
/// created in an interval for the full reward for that interval to be paid out.
///
/// The amount of KEEP to be distributed is determined by funding the contract,
/// and additional KEEP can be added at any time.
/// The reward contract is funded with `approveAndCall` with no extra data,
/// but it also collects any KEEP mistakenly sent to it in any other way.
///
/// An interval is defined by the timestamps [startOf, endOf);
/// a keep created at the time `startOf(i)` belongs to interval `i`
/// and one created at `endOf(i)` belongs to `i+1`.
///
/// When an interval is over, it will be allocated a percentage of the remaining
/// unallocated rewards based on its weight, and adjusted by the number of keeps
/// created in the interval if the quota is not met.
///
/// The adjustment for not meeting the keep quota is a percentage that equals
/// the percentage of the quota that was met; if the number of keeps created is
/// 80% of the quota then 80% of the base reward will be allocated for the
/// interval.
///
/// Any unallocated rewards will stay in the unallocated rewards pool,
/// to be allocated for future intervals. Intervals past the initially defined
/// schedule have a weight of 100%, meaning that all remaining unallocated
/// rewards will be allocated to the interval.
///
/// Keeps of the appropriate type can receive rewards once the interval they
/// were created in is over, and the keep has closed happily.
/// There is no time limit to receiving rewards, nor is there need to wait for
/// all keeps from the interval to close.
/// Calling `receiveReward` automatically allocates the rewards for the interval
/// the specified keep was created in and all previous intervals.
///
/// If a keep is terminated, that fact can be reported to the reward contract.
/// Reporting a terminated keep returns its allocated reward to the pool of
/// unallocated rewards.
///
/// @dev A concrete implementation of the abstract rewards contract must specify
/// functions for accessing information about keeps and paying out rewards.
/// For the purpose of rewards, Random Beacon signing groups count as "keeps"
/// and the beacon operator contract acts as the "factory".
