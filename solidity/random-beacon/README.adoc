= Keep Random Beacon v2

https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/actions/workflows/contracts-random-beacon.yml[image:https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/keep-network/keep-core/contracts-random-beacon.yml?branch=main&event=push&label=Random%20Beacon%20contracts%20build[Random Beacon contracts build status]]

The Keep Network requires a trusted source of randomness for the process of
trustless group selection. While the network requires that randomness to function
correctly, the source of randomness is itself broadly applicable. This trusted
source of randomness takes the form of a BLS Threshold Relay.

== Overview

The threshold relay is a way of generating verifiable randomness that is
resistant to bad actors both in the relay network and on the anchoring Ethereum
blockchain. The basic functioning of the relay is:

- Some number of groups exist in the relay.
- An arbitrary seed value `v_s` counts as the first entry in the relay.
- A request `r_i` is dispatched to the chain for a new entry.
- The previous entry `v_s` is used to choose a group to produce the response to
  the request.
- `v_s` is signed by at least a subset of the chosen group members, and the
  resulting signature is the entry generated in response to the request. It is
  published to the anchoring blockchain as the entry `v_i`.
- The new entry `v_i` may trigger the formation of a new group from the set of
  all members in the relay.
- A group expires after a certain amount of time.

== Prior Work

Smart contracts for the first version of the random beacon are available in
link:https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/main/solidity-v1[`solidity-v1` directory].
The new version uses the same approach for BLS signatures as v1 but replaces
ticket-based group selection with an optimistic sortition pool call. It also
redesigns staker rewards and offers a more operator-friendly approach for
relay entry timeouts. Last but not least, most parameters for the relay are
now governable. 

== The Mechanism

=== Group Creation

New groups are created with a fixed frequency of relay requests.
Instead of a v1 ticket-based approach for a signing group selection, we use
a sortition pool. Group creation start transaction is embedded into relay request
transaction and locks a sortition pool. From this moment, no operator can enter
or leave the pool. Once a new relay entry appears on the chain, all off-chain
clients perform group selection by calling `RandomBeacon.selectGroup()` view
function for free. After determining group members, clients should perform
off-chain distributed key generation (DKG).
<<operator-only,One of the group members>> submits the result to the chain calling
`RandomBeacon.submitDkgResult(DKG.Result calldata dkgResult)` function.
Once the result is submitted, a challenge period starts.

During the challenge period, anyone can notify that the submitted DKG result is
malicious by calling `RandomBeacon.challengeDkgResult(DKG.Result calldata dkgResult)`
function. A malicious DKG result may contain corrupted data, group members not
selected by the pool, or incorrect supporting signatures. If such malicious
result is submitted and successfully challenged, the result submitter gets
slashed and the malicious result is immediately discarded. The address which
notified about malicious DKG result is <<punishment,rewarded>>. DKG timeout
timer is reset, and group members have another chance to submit a valid result.

Once the challenge period passes, and no valid challenge is reported, the DKG
result submitter should mark the DKG result as approved calling
`RandomBeacon.approveDkgResult(DKG.Result calldata dkgResult)`.
This transaction also unlocks the sortition pool.
The submitter receives an ETH reimbursement for both `submitDkgResult` and
`approveDkgResult` transactions as described in
<<transaction-incentives,Transaction Incentives>> section. In case the original
submitter does not call the `approveDkgResult` function within a specific number
of blocks, anyone can do that and receive the submitter's reimbursement.

There is a timeout before which a DKG result should be submitted.
In case the DKG result was not submitted before the timeout, anyone can 
notify about the timed out DKG by calling `RandomBeacon.notifyDkgTimeout()`
function and unlock the sortition pool as part of this transaction. 
DKG timeout includes the situation when no new relay entry was produced
and sortition could not be performed.

Off-chain clients are expected to follow the <<operator-only,submission order>>
when submitting DKG result to avoid front-running and minimize the cost, but no
ordering is enforced on-chain.

The sortition pool weights operators by their authorized stake amount and allows
selecting the same operator to the wallet signing group multiple times.
Off-chain DKG protocol executes in the same way as for v1 and
inactive/disqualified members during the off-chain protocol are marked as
ineligible for <<rewards,rewards>> for a governable period of time when the DKG
result is approved.

Each group created in the system remains active for a certain period
of time. A group that expired is no longer selected for any new work. Group
expiration is performed in the relay request transaction.

=== Relay Request and Relay Entry

Authorized addresses can request a new relay entry (random number) by calling
`RandomBeacon.requestRelayEntry(IRandomBeaconConsumer callbackContract)`
function and providing an optional callback parameter.

In `requestRelayEntry` transaction, groups that reached their maximum lifetime
are getting expired and one of the remaining active groups is tasked with
producing a new relay entry. The off-chain clients are expected to monitor the
`RelayEntryRequested` event. If a client is a part of a picked group they should
start the off-chain protocol to sign the previous relay entry producing a new one.

Off-chain clients are expected to follow the <<operator-only,submission order>>
when submitting relay entry to avoid front-running and minimize the cost, but no
ordering is enforced on-chain. New relay entry should be submitted using 
`RandomBeacon.submitRelayEntry(bytes calldata entry)` function.

=== Callbacks

Random Beacon supports simple, low-gas-budget callbacks from a relay entry
submit transaction.

When requesting a relay entry, it is possible to pass an optional address
parameter - this is the address of a contract implementing
`IRandomBeaconConsumer` interface that should be called when a new relay entry
is submitted to the chain.

Smart contract consuming new relay entry needs to implement `IRandomBeaconConsumer`
interface. The gas limit for `__beaconCallback` is initially set to 56k gas
which is enough to `SSTORE` new relay entry, `SSTORE` block height in which the entry was submitted, and to emit an event.
Failure in the callback function does not revert the relay entry transaction.

```solidity
interface IRandomBeaconConsumer {
    /// @notice Receives relay entry produced by Keep Random Beacon. This function
    /// should be called only by Keep Random Beacon.
    ///
    /// @param relayEntry Relay entry (random number) produced by Keep Random
    ///                   Beacon.
    /// @param blockNumber Block number at which the relay entry was submitted
    ///                    to the chain.
    function __beaconCallback(uint256 relayEntry, uint256 blockNumber) external;
}
```

=== Timeouts

There are two timeouts for a relay entry to be provided by a group: soft timeout
and hard timeout.

==== Soft Relay Entry Timeout

If no entry was provided within the soft timeout, all operators in the group
start bleeding and losing their stake. The bleeding increases linearly from 0 to
the slashing amount per operator over time, until the hard timeout is
reached or until a relay entry is submitted by the group.

The soft timeout is a governable parameter. This gives a chance to start
with more forgiving penalties and increase them over time. In general, the
slashing penalty should be proportional to rewards and the frequency of relay
requests and associated risk.

==== Hard Relay Entry Timeout

When the hard timeout is reached, anyone can notify about this fact by calling
`RandomBeacon.reportRelayEntryTimeout()` function and receive a
<<punishment,notifier reward>> . The group which failed to submit a relay entry
is terminated, group members are slashed, and if there are still active groups
in the beacon, another group is selected and tasked with producing a relay entry
for the given relay request. 

==== DKG Timeout

There is a governable timeout for DKG to complete and for the result to be
submitted. DKG timeout includes the time it takes to execute off-chain protocol
to generate a key, and the time it takes to submit the result.
When DKG timeout is exceeded, anyone can call `RandomBeacon.notifyDkgTimeout()`.
This function unlocks the sortition pool and clears up DKG data, but no slashing
for DKG timeout is executed and no one is marked as ineligible for rewards.

[[inactivity]]
=== Inactivity notification

Off-chain clients are free to execute any heartbeat protocol they want to ensure
group member key material is still available and nodes are operating properly.

[TIP]
One example of a heartbeat protocol is signing some piece of information every
n-th block and making sure this piece of information cannot be used for
`RandomBeacon.reportUnauthorizedSigning()`. Specifically, the signed piece of
information can not become `msg.sender` for `reportUnauthorizedSigning` call.

Group members can agree to punish members who are permanently inactive and issue
an operator inactivity claim. If the required threshold of group members signed
the operator inactivity claim, they can submit it to
`RandomBeacon.notifyOperatorInactivity(Inactivity.Claim calldata claim, uint256 nonce, int32[] calldata groupMembers)`
function and have the group members who are inactive excluded from
the sortition pool <<rewards,rewards>> for a governable time period.

This approach is theoretically susceptible to group members colluding together,
but because a reasonably high number of operators is needed to sign a claim and
operators signing the claim receive nothing in return,
we consider this approach safe and good enough. An important advantage of this
approach is that honest players can decide off-chain when it makes sense to
submit an operator inactivity claim and mark someone as ineligible for rewards.
For example, marking an operator ineligible for rewards for the next two weeks
has a higher impact than prolonging reward ineligibility for 10 minutes for an
operator that was already marked as ineligible for rewards. This approach does
not increase the gas cost of a happy path and leaves some freedom to group
members. They can mark as ineligible operators who turned off their nodes,
operators whose nodes never participate in signing because they are
misconfigured, or operators who notoriously miss their turn in submitting relay
entries.

[[rewards]]
=== Rewards

T rewards are allocated to all operators registered in the beacon sortition
pool, excluding operators who were marked as ineligible for rewards as a result
of being reported by other group members as <<inactivity,inactive>> or as
a result of being inactive or disqualified during the DKG. Rewards are allocated
proportionally to the operator's weight in the pool. 

[[transaction-incentives]]
=== Transaction Incentives

There are three types of transactions: <<operator-only,Operator-Only>>,
<<public-knowledge,Public-Knowledge>>, and <<punishment,Punishment>>.

[[operator-only]]
==== Operator-Only
Operator-Only transactions are where only the operators have access to the
information required to assemble the transaction with the right input
parameters.

In order to avoid all operators racing to submit the transaction at the same
time, we have an off-chain informal agreement to submit based on the operator's
position in the group (can use the hash of the group's pubkey).

If the designated operator does not submit their transaction before a timeout
expires, the duty moves to the next operator and the group can sign a
transaction to mark that operator as <<inactivity,inactive>>. Since there is no
slashing reward, and since this transaction can only be submitted by an operator,
this transaction is also Operator-Only.

In order to compensate the operator for posting the transaction, the gas spent
will be reimbursed by a DAO-funded ETH pool in the same transaction. It is
important to note, that the system has a governable cap for the gas price to
protect against malicious operators trying to drain the pool (see `Reimbursable`
and `ReimbursementPool` smart contracts).

Operator-only transactions are `submitDkgResult`, `submitRelayEntry`,
`notifyOperatorInactivity`, and `approveDkgResult` for a certain number of
blocks, before a timeout for the original DKG result submitter to call this
function elapses.

[[public-knowledge]]
==== Public-Knowledge
Public-Knowledge transactions are where anyone has access to the information
required to assemble the transaction and the transaction does not lead to
punishment.

In order to prevent wasting gas on racing to submit, such transactions need to
be executed rarely, and off-chain clients should follow the informal agreement
about the submission order.

To compensate these transactions, whoever posts them will have the gas spent
reimbursed by a DAO-funded ETH pool in the same transaction.

The only public knowledge transaction is `notifyDkgTimeout`.

`approveDkgResult` turns into a public knowledge transaction in case the
original submitter has not approved the result before the timeout.

[[punishment]]
==== Punishment
Punishment transactions are where anyone has access to the information required
to assemble the transaction (like <<public-knowledge,Public-Knowledge>>) and
the transaction leads to slashing.

In these transactions, maintaining system health is more important than
optimizing gas via preventing racing, so we offer up bounties in the form of
a notifier reward from slashed tokens to whichever submitter submits first. We
do not compensate gas. Notification rewards are distributed by Threshold Network
`TokenStaking` contract.

Punishment transactions are: `challengeDkgResult`, `reportRelayEntryTimeout`,
and `reportUnauthorizedSigning`.
