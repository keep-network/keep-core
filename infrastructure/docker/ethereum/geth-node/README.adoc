= Build Geth Node Image

== WARNING ==

We are currently storing the passphrase for all accounts that we create on
the testnet in the file `passphrase` that lives in the same directory as this
README file. This is HORRIBLY INSECURE and only OK for the internal testnet.

== Build
To build the docker image:
```
docker build --pull --squash --no-cache --rm -t $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-node .
```

Build an image with five Keep client accounts:
```
docker build --build-arg KEEP_ACCOUNTS=5  --pull --squash --no-cache --rm -t $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-node .
```

== List
You can list your new image with this command:
```
docker images |grep geth-node
```

== Copy Keystore Files
You can copy the keystore files for the accounts created during the Docker run
with the following commands:
```
docker run --entrypoint="" --rm -v `pwd`:/out $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-node cp -rv /root/.geth/keystore /out
```

== Push Image
Push the image to Docker Hub:
```
docker push $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-node
```
