= Build Geth Dev Image

To build the docker image
```
docker build --pull --squash --no-cache --rm -t $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-dev .
```
If you get a `SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY` warning during build you can
ignore it. The optional dependency is only needed when running `Pm2` on OSX.

You can list your new image with this command:
```
docker images |grep geth-dev
```

Push the image to Docker Hub:
```
docker push $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-dev
```

Start a bash shell inside this Docker container:
```
docker run -it lispmeister/geth-dev
```

Check version of geth installed:
```
docker run --entrypoint="" --rm $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-dev /geth version
```
